He also has a letter out talking to employees about cutting costs. I’m wondering if VW could have an interest in merging with Tesla and having a stake in them for their batteries and tech. 
This article has a snippet discussing a rumor of that potentially happening back in 2019ish.

I’m going to start giving you all free money alerts. 

Called BABA at 255 a few weeks back, and PLUG at the end of October. I know the sub-species of idiots who exist on this sub need to earn some money to later lose on OTM calls for high-risk small cap companies that are at all time highs. I’m here to provide. 

There is no better purchase then Saleforce tomorrow, we are below all moving short &amp; long averages, and we of course have had another unprecedented crash on amazing news. Providing a wonderful opportunity for you idiots to buy in at an absolute low, when the company will be at all time highs within the next two months. 

I know some dumb cunts are going to be like “well their future outlook isn’t looking as good as we wanted” I’m here to tell you that when stocks have been crashing like Paul Walker after beating expectations for no reason, what do you do as a CEO and CFO to attempt to avoid this? You set the bar super fucking LOW to make sure your investors are nothing but happy and stop reducing your companies value by 10% every quarter. It’s like none of you have ever read a book on financial relations or PR.. Oh wait... 

Buy the stock or by calls, whatever you want to do, Saleforce will absolutely make you money this month. Merry Christmas assholes.

EDIT: Well boys and girls if you got in early this morning; Christmas came fucking early.

EDIT 2: Position adjustment: Day traded 12/31 250C for roughly 50% gain. Due to larger sell off then anticipated adjusted the Strike to 12/31 240C. 

There also seems to be a misconception about what I expect to gain from these contracts, and I need to make sure that everyone understands I do not chase 4000% gains. I’m not betting on CRM going to 300 by the end of December. 

When it comes to making money with bullish OTM positions the question is simple: Will the stock price rise enough, and at a high enough ROC (Average ROC presented with IV) to overcome the loss of speculative value, or Theta from its current position? When I release free money alerts I’m telling you that within the expiration date this will occur. Whether you want to hold and hope that it continues is fully up to you. In other words I’m happy to tell you what to buy, but I won’t tell you when to take profit. 

In other words people, don’t get greedy and bag-hold your fucking calls over the next month if you have OTM’s. Take advantage of the oversell on the bounce back and get out. You don’t buy OTM hoping for real value by the time they expire you buy them to sell on the one big day it bounces back.",2020-12-02 05:37:43

I've been disheartened by some of the comments I've read recently and just wanted to provide some tips for the genuine noobies/retards among us. If you already know this shit, congrats, move along sir.

Take a look at my previous, more advanced guide to some theta gang theory for those looking for something a bit more in depth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how\_to\_consistently\_outperform\_the\_sp500\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/)

Without further ado... TOP 5 TIPS Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.

# 1) You MUST understand Implied Volatility.

I made this the first point because it is the gigantic mistake I see noobies here making again and again. I'm talking to you, people who bought calls on PLTR at $30.  **If you learn anything from this post, you MUST learn this.**

You see a stock make a massive move either up or down. Your immediate response is ""this is a great opportunity to buy calls/puts on a volatile stock!"" Right? WRONG!

In fact, when a stock has just made a massive move in either direction, that is perhaps the WORST time to purchase options in EITHER direction. Options are not stupid. Options are designed to price in the fact that a stock is moving wildly. This is called ""implied volatility."" They become more expensive as a stock makes more dramatic moves, to price in the volatility you and everyone else is expecting.

It's quite possible and even likely that you buy an option on a high IV stock, and the stock moves in your direction, and yet you LOSE money, because it didn't move as dramatically as was expected by the implied volatility. **This is called ""IV crush.""** It only takes one or two experiences with IV crush for most traders to learn this lesson for life. If you understand this concept before you lose a ton of money, all the better.

**So, what should you do if a stock is highly volatile and options are expensive due to IV?**

There are two choices: Trade actual shares, or SELL the options rather than buy them.

If you are bullish on a high IV stock, you can take a bullish position by SELLING a cash-secured put rather than buying the call. If you are bearish on a high IV stock, you can take a bearish position by SELLING a call rather than buying a put (although this entails greater risk and will typically require higher options trading level by your broker).

# 2) You MUST have patience.

It's a tale as old as time. A noobie investor does some research, reads some DD, and is convinced a stock is going to rise over the next couple years. So he buys in. A bad day or two hits and the stock tanks. He panics, and sells. The next couple days the stock rises and appears to stabilize. So he buys back in again, because he still believes in his thesis. The stock drops again, and he panic sells again.

In reality the stock is just trading sideways, but this idiot keeps buying on green days and selling on red days. This is perhaps the most idiotic, suicidal strategy anyone could ever employ. Buying on green and selling on red is a surefire strategy to lose money consistently over time.

This is why you MUST remove your emotions from your trades, because your emotions will usually tell you to buy on green and sell on red, literally buy high and sell low. As the boomer Warren Buffett once stated: **""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**

Here is a better approach. Set up your entire trade BEFORE you make the trade. Have a set price you will sell at if things go south. Have a target price you will sell at if things go well. Once the dust settles you can learn from any mistakes. Were you too aggressive, or too conservative in your targets? What emotions directed you to make those mistakes? Too much greed, too much risk aversion, too LITTLE risk aversion? Make every trade a learning opportunity.

# 3) You MUST understand ""Reversion to the Mean.""

In general, stocks will tend to revert to their trendlines.

This thesis is fairly simple. If a stock moons 10% in a day, the most likely event is a drop the next day. If a stock tanks 10% in a day, the most likely event is a rise the next day. This is because humans are emotional creatures. First, they overreact to big news. Next, one of two things happen: When the stock is way up, people see it as a profit taking opportunity, so they sell. When the stock is way down, people see it as a buying opportunity, so they buy.

I don't have any hard data to back up this thesis, but I'm sure there's a bunch of nerds out there with hard data that proves exactly this, as well as trading algorithms specifically designed for a ""reversion to the mean"" strategy that are consistently profitable.

Obviously there will be exceptions, as well as times when a big move signals a shift in the trendline. All I am saying is in the MAJORITY of cases, reversion to the mean will occur. Don't go chasing stocks that have made massive short-term swings in a single direction unless you have strong reasons (not just hopes) to believe the trend has changed.

# 4) You MUST not YOLO your account more than once (or twice).

This is going to be controversial for some of you. But it's just straight math. If you keep betting your entire account, or close to it, on single trades, **it's only a matter of time before you go broke. That is a mathematical guarantee.**

Let's say you are one of the most skilled, intelligent, informed investors on the planet (doubtful). So skilled your plays are 90% correct. If you bet your entire portfolio on each trade, you are still expected to go completely broke after around 10 trades.

Let's say you aren't a brilliant stonk gambler. Let's say you are just average and your trades are a coin flip (which is generous for a lot of you retards). **If you bet your entire bankroll on each bet, on average you will go completely broke in just 2 trades.**

Again, there is a lot of complicated math we can go through to predict account explosion times and optimal bet sizing and so on, but that isn't necessary here. Professional gamblers such as poker players have refined bankroll management theory, which usually means at the least they aren't putting more than 10% of their cash on the table in one sitting, usually closer to 5%. (Take a look at the ""Kelley criterion"" for an interesting read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion))

I know a lot of you are broke with no life prospects and hoping to get rich quick. I don't fault you for that, I get it. The problem arises when you see the people who got insanely lucky with guessing 10 coin flips in a row who turned $1000 into $1,000,000, and hope to do the same... **but for every one retard with a record like that you've got hundreds more who lose it all and have nothing to show for it.**

I won't fault anyone for making a gigantic, life-changing bet a single time. That is your choice to make, and it just might pay off. But if you think you are going to do that again and again and survive, you are delusional.

# 5) You MUST be Skeptical... of EVERYTHING.

Fools and their money are soon parted. Don't be a fool.

Your first instincts when hearing ANYTHING should be skepticism. Your friend has a hot stock tip? Start with skepticism. Some online DD on a meme or penny stock online sounds convincing? Start with skepticism. A highly respected financial or government agency gives future guidance on whatever... again, start with skepticism.

There are a million people out there trying to take advantage of you, to pump and dump you, to scam you, to trick you into spending more money on whatever.

There are times when being a conformist pays off, like when markets rally for months straight. There are times when being a contrarian pays off, like when markets tank and sectors collapse. Don't be a consistent conformist nor a consistent contrarian. Be skeptical of every thesis and every hypothesis you hear, or even the ones you invent yourself.

When you take this approach honestly and still become convinced of a thesis, you have a higher probability than most of being correct.

**Seek out opinions that contradict your biases, not opinions that confirm your biases.** This is incredibly difficult and goes against human nature, but if you can achieve this ideal, you will out-trade 90% of the public.

Anyway why not start a campaign to write the SEC to look into the over shorting of GME.

I have witnessed EXPE, ROOM, HLF and Volkswagen shorts, but never seen anything like this. How do you even short anymore than the float ? do you just make up shares which is illegal under the guidelines and trading rules.  

Then how do you get 65.16 million shares outstanding and 67.45 million shares short. Even if the float wasn't enough they shorted 2.29 million shares over every share ever issued in this company. How is it even possible? The answer is it isn't and it's illegal

You dipped your life savings into NIO or XPEV because you want to jump on the next Chinese Tesla, that's fine. No need to panic. There's a vote tomorrow that a lot of retail investors are panicking about because ""AlL ChyNeSe StocKs aRe GeTTinG deListEd"". Bro. Look at this shitty spreadsheet I made, the panic today was in the EV sector, not Chinese stonks. Look at fucking $BABA and $JD chilling, huge market cap companies not panicking on a vote tomorrow,  know why? Because there's no fucking chance in hell they get de-listed.

Even if this vote passes, the companies get THREE YEARS to comply with the US about their stock exchanges being audited by US companies. Before you say NIO is audited by an American company, no it's not, it's a Chinese branch of that company and the US wants their own hooligans in there, which by law in China is not allowed because Chyna #1

Here's why you shouldn't panic:

Look at fucking Baillie Gifford and Company who own 8.91% of NIO who KNEW about the bill proceeding to the house from passing the senate in MAY 2020. They increased their ownership by over  ELEVEN MILLION SHARES, don't know how much money that is my smooth brained companion? That's over a $495M bet on NIO going upsies.

But one interesting thing is just to highlight a section of this DD that actually fulfilled today as promised:

**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist** [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/)**:**

>Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80.While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is \[redacted\][(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run. Compare \[redacted\] with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (\~$15.80). The difference between \[redacted\] and $GME is that \[redacted\] was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on. The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG). Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day.This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade. So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.

Extreme TL;DR = Current cup and handle pattern of GME means if there is a bounce at $15.80, that means breakout is imminent.

And lo and behold, what do we see? The markets ended at $15.80 on the dot, and the afterhours pricing is already back up to $15.92, as foretold by [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/).

What will happen when there is a breakout? Apparently through TA our resident prophet figured out the breakeven point for short sellers is $15.80, and if GME passes the test at the $15.80 support level and begins to climb again, short sellers are gonna start panicking and start buying back share en masse, which will drive the short squeeze. Ooorrrrrr, they can short even MORE to try and squash the price down, but come earnings report on Dec 8th, if either the report was better than expected, or if Cohen, the dude who built a billion dollar fucking dog food company, does a hostile take over for GME due to less than stellar reports, again, that's a catalyst for the stocks to go up, leading again to short sellers getting fucked if they don't start buying back shares.  


If we autistic fucks can see this and figure this out, then FOR SURE the institutions and investment firms who shorted GME can see this and figure this out too. So their move is to keep shorting and not break the line as a whole and hope that we bow out and panic sell. And what are we waitinf for? We're waiting for the firms to panic, break rank, and start to buy up shares to cover their puts. So literally this situation is like two armies staring at each other, each waiting for the other to break their line first and turn tail and run. IT'S A FUCKING WESTERN SHOW DOWN. 

That is why, for all you paper hand mofos, literally stop it. Stop it. Stop selling and HOLD FOR AT LEAST A MONTH YOU PANSY BITCHES! Don't you realize the investment firms are scared, fund managers are gonna get fired if the short squeeze happens, so they're doing everything in their power to keep prices down by shorting, wanting cause fear among average joe retail investors like us? This is the wealth transfer from the 1% back to the common people we've been waiting for! If ONLY y'all don't bitch out and stand the line strong! Just be patient and if calls are too risky, just fuking buy shares then! Then you can factor out the risk of time and just enjoy the tendies at the end of the month!

Lastly, just like what Citron did to PLTR, plain old market manipulation by publishing a bogus report and price target on PLTR and taking money from all the paper hand bitches here, I'd expect desperate boomer firms to try some equal bullshit in scaring you all to selling. Just expect it to come and HOLD DAMN IT. This is the short squeeze opportunity of a lifetime, and you get to be part of history, and one day you'll be able to tell your grandkids how you fucked up, missed the $500 peak cuz you got too greedy, and sold it at $60 instead.

TL;DR = GME, Tendies, Moon.

DD,SUMO - Going Belly Up,17,k4xe1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4xe1l/sumo_going_belly_up/,20,1606895593.0,"As you regret your post Turkey day belly gains, let me give you a bit of insight into SUMO. I've started a medium sized position and am expecting this to go belly up over the coming weeks. Hoping y'all can get in before the run-up is too late.

**My Positions**:

https://preview.redd.it/j4y6eiguwn261.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69345e8adbae2e1bc707664b1a453fb3a63641f

**Background**:

SUMO is a cloud based analytics platform that enables clients to summarize their data and provide extra security. Think of it as a mini-PLTR with a focus on cyber security and issue management. They IPO'ed on Sept 17.

As far as their product goes - it plays well with all major products including AWS, GCP, and Azure. That speaks to their client base, which ranges from Pokemon Go to Airbnb, but includes whales like $BUD and $DAL - any company who values data and cyber security is in play.

[Financials](https://investor.sumologic.com/static-files/ede9f243-bb20-40a3-b3e9-d60835488125) look good - they've grown 50% YOY for the past few years with extremely low large customer contributions (2100+ customers). Revenue is $155m, which is like .0001% of the cloud security/analytics market share ($50b TAM). All revenue is recurring, and all clients are locked into multi-year deals when they sign. Clients don't seem to churn, and are in fact increasing their revenue spend as the contract goes on.

They do have significant competition in companies like DDOG ($550m in Rev / $30b in market cap), SNOW ($400m in Rev / $90b market cap), and CRWD ($480m in Rev / $33b market cap) vs their $155m in Rev and $2.6b in market cap. Institutions are starting to grab shares - 60% institutional ownership and climbing fast. 

**Research**:

They break their business into 3 tiers: Small, mid, and enterprise market. They have 70+ openings (\~ 10% of headcount), with a focus on Enterprise and Sales positions, which would indicate they are expecting high growth and a focus on larger clients. 

They've projected slower growth rates into Q1 and Q2 of 2021 at about 25-30%, which caused their stock price to fall off when they IPO'ed (since recovered). However, they are also projecting much lower costs, which will lead to higher margins and profit.

Recent reviews on Glassdoor haven't been friendly, granted most tech companies let go lots of people with COVID and those employees need a forum to express frustration. Their new leadership seems focused on growth and the IPO, which may not be fun for most employees, but will be good for profit margins.

**Play/TLDR**:

Earnings is Dec 7. Buy shares and sell covered calls to grab high premiums for Dec earnings and roll it into longer dated OTM calls in Feb/March. Unless they beat guidance massively for Q1/Q2, the stock will sit tight, and then gain over the coming weeks as institutions continue buying.",2020-12-02 02:53:13

Closing price was 246.34 which makes 0.0776 worth $19.11. So that makes Slack stock worth about $45.90/share. But that definitely isn't 27.7 billion. You can see what the price should be based on different market caps in the photo. So for that acquisition it should be around $48.50

What am I missing here?

Imagine believing all the autists spamming PLTR HURDUR TO DA MOON REEEE every post last week, and i mean literally every post. Where are you cucks now? Weeklies expired worthless? Panic sold at todays dip? Good.


Same goes for nio and tesla paperhand cucks who sold today based off Nikola tanking after the Lockout period ending. YOU KNEW THIS WAS A SCAM. Options merely allowed people to make money on a clear falling knife stock, and if you yolod into pltr weeklies or owned nkla stonks you deserved to give your wendys paycheck to thetagang.


My point being is to DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH BEFORE entering a position, not AFTER.


Nio is looking extremely bullish in 2-5 years, a forecast of $300 is not unlikely. This is not ""long term"" in stock terms at all.

Same with pltr. We know tesla will continue to experience meme levels of growth until elon dies and it tanks, or they end up turning more thsn a 1% profit. Either way don't doubt lord musk.

Lidar sensors, which use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car, are seen as essential by **many automakers** to allow higher levels of driver assistance right up to making them capable of **self-driving**. The combined company will retain the name Luminar Technologies Inc. and list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""LAZR”. Since the announcement in august, GMHI stock is up 38%, bringing the mkt cap to $1.7 Bln. The deal should be completed by Q1 2021 and the merge pro forma implied enterprise value of approximately $2.9 Bln and a market capitalization of approximately $3.4 Bln, so today we are trying to understand if there’s more room for tendies after the *bullish bonanza* of the previous week.

**Gentlemen you had my curiosity ... but now you have my attention**

There are some serious players behind this deal so let’s break them down:The deal includes $400 million of cash from Gores Metropoulos, whose founder is a private equity professional, $200 million financing by investors including tech billionaire **Peter Thiel** (PayPal, Palantir), GoPro Inc founder Nick Woodman, Volvo Cars Tech Fund and VectoIQ, the firm that helped Nikola Corp go public through a SPAC.

**Ehy but w8 a sec, I can see NIO there but no TESLA, WHERE’S MUSK DADDY?!?...Why Tesla Won’t Use LIDAR**

*Let me quote the greatest absolute madman of our century: LIDAR is a fool’s errand… and anyone relying on LIDAR is doomed.*LIDARS are expensive and prone to be damaged, also not very smart in recognizing object, that’s why Musk has opted for the proprietary VISION software which enables TESLA cams to understand the surrounding environment instead of shooting stupid lazer beams. Surely a great approach but right now their technology has a gap to bridge as they stated in one of their last meetings. Whether they will succeed or not isn’t really important for a company which aims to get on the market hopefully sooner than them. Obviously, companies such as Daimler and Volvo (which historically sold **safety** as their key selling point)  would be very happy to sell AD4 cars by 2022.

**Ok but why tf should I buy shares of a company founded by a 17 years old dropout?**

Surely there are many companies working on similar projects such as Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Aurora, which aim to reach level 5 of autonomous driving (fully autonomous), but Luminar hits a different market. With a more modest target of hitting level 4 of autonomous driving, Luminar focuses on long-distance vision, key for highway driving. Yet, this is also a crowded market since players like Velodyne and others exist. Well not so crowded maybe, Velodyne has lost clients in the last year, it had Ford but they partnered with Luminar...they had Weymo (Google) but they went for their own road just as Tesla. Not to mention that Velodyne sensors have a crazy price at $25K.

**Since this is a DD post, I will not get into the technical details of why their technology has** ***some*** **breakthroughs, but let’s break down some more numbers**

We don’t have balance sheets so we will have to rely on their presentation (which is where all the images come from btw). They expect 90% of future revenue coming from their 50+ already signed partnerships, and with a 50% + margin, selling both hardware **AND** software, this could be a great company to invest in (or just go for quick tendies who am I to judge).

You can check further technical details about their technology and implementation on their presentation but the last figures I want to concentrate on is the following: as of 2020 there is no other LIDAR long-vision competitor, also their price tag is about $1000 for the IRIS sensor, which is 25 times cheaper than its closest competitor. This could really scale up quickly if the outsourcing production process is handled correctly, which by the way will take place in Thailand and Mexico.

Back then when asked why he was interested in KaloBios he said he was significantly focused on a specific one of their assets, Lenzilumab. A drug he believed was very promising and underdeveloped. 

Well Shkreli was forced out of the company and made to sell his shares due to his ongoing legal issues - eventually landing him in jail where he remains today. 

Fast forward a few years and the company KaloBios renamed itself to Humanigen ($HGEN) to rid themselves of the previous reputation - and the drug Lenzilumab is on the verge of becoming one of only a few therapeutics authorized by the FDA for treatment of the most severe cases of COVID. And now one of only a few therapeutics that are currently partnered with the government BARDA/Operation Warp Speed which have kept tight lipped about lenzilumab. https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx

Additionally, Virgin Galactic was awarded a $45million contract from NASA yesterday, and has previously picked up contracts from other governments as well. Reopening reservations, landing contracts, expanding to hypersonic point to point travel, orbital flights, and massive publicity from existing reservations is on the horizon.

This shit's got a lot lot more room to run. My bull thesis is $50+ by Richard Branson's flight, even more if shorts pile in and get burned.

On December 11, S&P will announce which company is getting the boot from the index. This is a huge put opportunity! 

Market cap requirements for S&P500 today are $5.5 billion so our list should include companies that fell below that number. Market cap was the main reason Macy's was removed.

Next we look at profitability and look at companies that show negative net income.

This leaves us with a few candidates mostly in energy space, replacing TSLA with an oil company can also be symbolic:

**DVN** - Devon Energy Corp - Mkt. Cap  5,351,567 and net income -355.00 M

**NOV** - National-Oilwell - Mkt. Cap 4,760,117 and net income -6,095.00 M

**DXC** - Dxc Technology Company - Mkt. Cap 5,574,167 and net income -5,369.00 M

**HAL** - Halliburton Company - Mkt. Cap 14,665,676 and net income -1,131.00 M

**OXY** - Occidental Petroleum - Mkt. Cap 14,675,854 and net income -667.00 M

**APA** - Apache Corp - Mkt. Cap 4,865,692 and net income -3,553.00 M


These are the 6 candidates I got puts on, they are pretty affordable too. 

What other companies could be on the chopping block? Under Armor? GE?

If people actually appreciate this stuff, I'll be happy to take the time to write up more of these.  


Who am I/What do I do? I'm a fellow autist, but I'm also a licensed portfolio manager and I work for an investment firm that shall remain nameless. I don't trade on their behalf, so I'm free to do whatever I want on my own portfolio. 

&#x200B;

When buying a call (or a put), you're effectively buying the right to purchase a stock at a set price.  
With a call, you are paying someone for the right to buy their shares at a specific price. This is called the **Strike price**. Your contract also has an expiry date. If the stock is below the strike price on/before the expiry, your option expires worthless, and your maximum loss is the amount of money you paid for the contract.  
If the stock is above the strike price on/before the expiry, you can either sell the contract, or hold onto it with the hope of it continueing to go up. At expiry, if the contract is ""in the money"" (profitable), then you have the right to exercise this contract and buy the shares for the strike price.

  
Your call option has several things incorporated in it for the price you pay.

1) you have the time value. How long is left between the day you buy vs the day it expires.

2) Implied volatility of the stock between the day you buy and the day it expires (how much the expected move in the stock is between now and the expiry date)

3) the difference in price between the option's strike and the stock's price

4) The supply/demand factor.

&#x200B;

Let's use real-life examples:  
You buy 100 shares of GME. You're paying  **16.19** per share as of right now. That means you need to invest 1619$ today to have ownership of these shares.

Your maximum downside is 1619$, your upside is unlimited.

If shares drop back down to 5$, you lose 1,119$ \[ (16.19 - 5) x 100 \]  
If shares run to 30$, you make 1,381$ \[ (30 - 16.19) x 100 \]

December 31 2020 16$ call options currently have a bid of 3.15$ and an ask of 3.40$.  
Which means, if you buy at market price, you're paying 3.40$ per share for the right to buy shares between now and december 31st at 16$.  
Assuming you hold until that day, your break-even price is 19.40$.  
However, you only pay 3.40\*100 = 340$ for this right.

If the stock drops back to 5$, your maximum loss is 340$ in this scenario.  
Your upside however, is unlimited.  
If shares run up to 30$ on december 10th, you still have some time value to the options, plus you have some implied volatility, plus you have the movement.  
So, your 16$ calls will probably sell for slightly more than 14$ (30-16).  
At expiry, you'll have the option to either a) sell those options or b) have them exercise, allowing you to buy the shares for 16$.  


The leverage effect comes in the fact that you only paid 340$ for this contract and in the fact that you get the upside of those 100 shares without as large of a cash outlay.  


If you're right on the direction and the timing of your bet, you can make a lot of money.

If you're wrong, this acts as a way to minimize your losses.

As SaaS companies continue to report earnings over the rest of this week and next (SUMO reports 12/7), I think SUMO will see several significant upgrades from analysts, especially as its business is better in a Covid-free world and company guidance should reflect increased optimism.

&#x200B;

**GameStop Gimp Suit:** This Gamestop branded gimp suit would be great to buy all the GameStop bears you know for them to enjoy as the stock price climbs to $50 dollars. 

**GameStop Gin (GinStop):** Gin is a fantastic mixer, perfect for the high class individuals of WSB to enjoy in their mixed drink of choice while they ride the tendie train.

**GameStop clothing partnership Autism Speaks:** A good CEO always rewards their diehard employees and customers.  This is a no-brainer easy reward to support the people who've been with GameStop since it was at $4 a share.

VALE, however, has been solidly rising every single day.

I think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a ""cap"" on the market, as most Americans only own one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.

Long story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winners will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries regardless if it's Tesla, NIO, Toyota, GM, or Xpeng. At end of the day, the winner will be TSLA and the automakers people are already familiar with: Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, etc. Not some obscure name like SOLO that operates out of a mall kiosk.

Dynatrace provides cloud-based, AI-driven observability. For us retards, that means they do big software shit that sounds cool.

**Why invest in DT?**

DT is like the Tesla of observability; they started out by targeting a niche market of high end customers. They primarily look at 1B+ revenue customers, and they've got an ARR of ~230k for ~2500 of those. Thing is, the number of 1B+ rev companies that are within DT's target demographic is more like 15k, so they're only 17% penetrated right now.

**Little Competition**

The other big player in the space
 is New Relic, but they're focused on much smaller businesses. Cisco is another competitor but they're laughably smaller. DT currently has ~70% of the F500 on its platforms. 

**Expectations**

The average price target for DT is $49 and the high is $59, so there's plenty of room to get some sweet tendies here. COVID has only sped things up because companies have to transition to the cloud and DT offers both legacy and cloud solutions. DT is also pretty undervalued relative to its peers in the DevOps space with a multiple of 19. We all know DevOps is the next major tech subsector and DT looks like it'll be leading the charge in the observability space.

Hey everyone and Welcome! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.

Almost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)

Energy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.

Here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company’s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)

Great news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it’s GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.

Also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it’s shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.

Also relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.

While the hydrogen power Nikola seen it’s share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock… So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.

Good news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.

Other great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe’s, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.

While on the vaccine front, Moderna’s candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it’s head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they’re first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don’t believe it’s worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.

The only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.

Meanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn’t gone to far to the left.

So I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.

""The software system is produced by the controversial US tech firm Palantir and will pull together information from different government computers to monitor the flow of people and vehicles across the UK border.

Palantir has courted controversy in the United States, where its systems are used by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This has led the human rights organisation Amnesty International to warn of ""a high risk that Palantir is contributing to serious human rights violations of migrants and asylum-seekers"".

The company denies the suggestion and says it remains extremely concerned about protecting human rights, privacy rights, and civil liberties in general.

The UK government has stressed that Palantir will only process data in Britain and that strict measures are in place to protect personal information.""

But now, it always closes green. 
On higher than average volume.

▶ What does it mean?

🚀 Bulls are winning

🚀 Big players aren't selling the shares they loaded up at $10-$13. Bullish

🚀 It's safer to buy in the second half of the trading day; personally, I usually buy in the last 3 hours and again in the last 5 minutes before market close

 If today's red, the closest trendline support + fib extension is at $15.92. Keeping pocket money in the unlikely case it drops that low wouldn't hurt

Weekly highs resistance since the last cycle is at $20.67, after that the sky is the limit.

▶ Q3 earnings expectations?

🚀 If their guidance shows a stronger focus on e-commerce rather than brick-and-mortar stores, we'll surely see a pump, as that would kill every GME = Blockbuster shorter's theory. Bullish.

🚀 If they don't mention that and the price dumps, Cohen might step in and increase his stake, finally guiding GME into the 21st century. That would be a major squeeze catalyst. Bullish.

The earnings that matter the most though, are in Q4 (March 2021). They will show what a e-commerce powerhouse GME has become.

That said, I'm personally holding through earnings, hoping for a dump and a takeover by Cohen.  ""Worst"" case scenario the price pumps and I can't load up at cheaper prices. 
That's why I'd rather have an amount of shares I'm happy with before earnings.

▶ When do I cash out?

Realistically, whenever you're happy with the profits you've made.

🚀 The price peaked around $60s and the mid $50s in the last two console cycles, respectively. Now that GME has a modern business model it can be safely guessed that it can reach at least previous highs

🚀 No one can tell how high the price will be with the squeeze. I can tell you it's gonna be $200 if that makes you wet your pants, but that'd be wishful thinking cause, again, I can't guess how high it will be. $50 is already a good enough PT for me

That said, I'm happy I feel safe holding shares through earnings, for once. 

I wish you all the greasiest tendies. Hold to Valhalla 🚀🚀🚀

I haven’t seen any dd posts recently so consider this a reminder and don’t get caught sleeping. 

For those that haven’t heard, the private company AvePoint and the public SPAC Apex Technologies agreed to a reverse merger last week that will become official by Q1 2021, most likely by the end of January or beginning of February. 

So, what is AvePoint? AvePoint was founded in 2001 and is a partner of Microsoft. They work in management, protection, and storage of data for Microsoft office 365. (I know you retards apparently love data companies like PLTR so this is right up your alley).

AvePoint has strong business relations with Microsoft and has won Microsoft company of the year 5 of a possible 19 times and the Microsoft VP sits on the board of directors for AvePoint. They also have some legitimate leadership with one of their co-founders being the former CFO of Oracle and the other co-founder being the former head of tech investing at Goldman Sachs. 

On top of that their financials are pretty phenomenal as they have no outstanding debt, 250 million in cash reserves, are profitable, and have been growing in revenue steadily YoY. They are projected to grow roughly 40% in revenue by 2022 too, as they are seeing huge upticks in demand as businesses around the globe are continually transitioning to cloud services and moving their businesses online. 

AvePoint will be priced at a $2 billion valuation once the merger is official and they go public.  

For comparison one of their main competitors, Snowflake, is valued at about 90 billion, while having about only twice the current revenue of AvePoint’s. 

Hypothetically, if AvePoint were to become half the value of Snowflake based on revenues, it would be worth more than 20x what it will be at the time it goes public. 

Not saying it’s going to become worth 45 billion but we could see it balloon to 20 billion+ easily, which would still be about 15x what it is now. 

Lastly, they currently do not have calls but as the merger date gets closer, options will be added so you idiots can blow up your accounts on FDs. 

TL;DR Buy apex Technologies and be prepared for the rocket ride.

There's an alternative piece by Seeking Betas, in case you're a peasant that can't afford Wall Street Journal's subscription (everyone should be rich af from PLTR calls 🚀🚀 ). You can google it yourself bc I can't post it.

But waittttt, AAPL will probably gap up since with that fat volume eod and that article that was posted at like 12AM EST. Well first of all, there's probably some insider trading shit right there. Fuck them for not tell us. Secondly, you're right. AAPL will probably get bigly erectly and gape up when the market opens. Fuck that means we can't profit from this right?

His main post and points can be found below. My thoughts come after his. 

 

🚀🚀🚀 **DD - Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd ($PSTH)** 🚀🚀🚀

In recent weeks there has been a lot of interesting action in the stock market as it relates to $PSTH. Despite a lot of noise and speculation (if one were to go looking), the major news outlets and press have been quiet. This DD makes the argument (based on the available evidence) that Bill Ackman’s blank cheque company, PSTH, will announce a merger with Stripe, securing a \~10-20% position in the company and taking it public.

This can be discredited as conjecture, but most things on WSB can be and are before they are realized. There is simply too much evidence here in favor of this happening to be ignored any longer.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Information/Timeline of Events:**

\- In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH – the SPAC raised $4B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B making it the biggest SPAC ever.

\- The SPAC is designed very differently than others and incentivizes long term holding. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long term holding of the company and is referenced in the ""tontine"" name - look it up, pretty cool.

\- Ackman has given several interviews since the listing of PSTH arguing that they are very well positioned to target and capture a unicorn (large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company.) Early speculation included AirBnB. While Ackman held talks with the company, they didn’t get to the point where his people got an inside look at the financials and he basically said they had no idea what they were dealing with despite liking how the company looked on the outside.

\- Ackman in the same videos talked up Stripe as a quality company but one not ready to go public, specifically citing managerial deficits.

\- Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next Google. They control a large percentage of online payments at present.

\- Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money, giving Visa/Mastercard as the obvious example.

**- In the weeks since those interviews, several key events have taken place as follows:**

o Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC

o Square executive joins board of PSTH

o **Seth Klarman** ($30B hedge fund manager “the next Buffet” and noted value investor, disclosed a $400M position in PSTH).

o **Guuggenheim** buys 22,000,000 $PSTH shares

o **Warren Buffet** has slashed his JPM position almost entirely potentially signifying a shift towards other financials? With online sales through the roof (this is just getting press in the last 2-3 days in earnest), he could be making a final gigantic long-term play for $BRK before he passes away). What better choice than a money maker based on money.

o Warren Buffet is secretly building a large position and hiding it from the press/pushing filing deadlines as much as possible. $BRK on record saying they want in on energy or tech giant.

o There is a large and undisclosed PSTH somewhere in the market that is not Klarman’s.

o In recent days the pre-market movement has been very odd. Several million positions. Pre-market on Friday for example, stock was up nearly **9%** for some of the morning. Has consistently hit after-market highs the next day. The data is trending in a very clear direction.

o The most cited (and really only) example of why this won't be Stripe is some troll that one of the brothers made on twitter. If they are indeed in negotiations, or getting ready to re-present to PSTH given all their new hiring, and given PSTH work in securing top of the line investors (**Klarman, Guggenheim, Blackstone, Ontario Teacher's Union**), this wouldn't be a bad negotiation tactic. They know the PSTH offer must come with some concessions.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ends his post, now lets take a look at his points one by one that are relevant to STRIPE.

1. Stripe is a quality company but one that is not yet ready to go public. How is this conjecture even mildly relevant to him hinting at a possible stripe acquisition? He said himself that he is looking for a mature company, and Bill himself believes that Free Cash Flow is number one when looking into a company. Stripe does not fit this bill.
2. Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next google. That's great, and? There are a plethora of upcoming tech companies, seemingly more everyday, that are being praised as the next google. Praising a company as good and comparing it to a titan which it is not similar too in almost any way is not relevant for the point that is trying to be made. 
3. Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money. He has publicly disclosed that he has made mistakes missing companies that make money in a manner similar to this in the past. SEVERAL TIMES. Why do you believe he won't do it again?

4 and 5. o Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with   
focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC and a Square executive joins board of PSTH, These   
are the only two points that I believe hold any interesting merit at all. 

6. Seth Klarman has a large position in the company. This is great. It has nothing to do with stripe.   
The entire tontine warrant structure absolutely reeks of value due to it incentivizing holding   
through merger in order to claim warrant fractionals. Seth Klarman is a value investor. This is the   
only deduction you and honestly, and reasonably make.

7. Guuggenheim has millions of shares, as well as the ontario pension board. Now why would these   
two buy? First of all, you can't make any reasonable attributions to stripe, there are no links.   
Guuggenheim holds most of these shares in their  Guggenheim Fds Tr-Guggenheim Total Return   
Bond Fund. A BOND FUND. Why? Because these SPAC shares almost act like a zero coupon bond,   
the same reason the pension board likely owns them. If worse comes to worse, they can redeem   
their shares for 20 dollars at merger date, but most likely higher than that the way spacs   
perform.  

8. Warren Buffet slashed his JPM and has an undisclosed stake. There is also a large portion of   
undisclosed PSTH. We don't know the size of Warren's missing investment. We also know this is   
not really up his alley, so if these are linked it's an investment by Ted or Todd. The missing shares   
could be more than a single holder as well. 

9. In recent days stonk go up. What does this have to do with stripe?

&#x200B;

TLDR- Bill Ackman followed some stripe people on twitter so apparently PSTH his going to be acquiring a portion of stripe. Please convince me otherwise, because I would love to invest in Stripe.

Right now $PEN is facing lots of legal trouble due to their Xtra Flex catheter killing and injuring several people. This summer it was announced that they will be facing lots of legal issues from this. Also, late this summer the company's CEO/President sold around $1.5 million worth of $PEN stock. You're probably thinking ""why the fuck has penumbra jumped up $100 since summer if all that shit happened"", honestly I don't know either, but recently a lot more people are finding out about whats happening and after hedge fund manager Gabriel Grego brought up that $PEN is going to shit its been a red day every day for the stock.

1. SOR: You need to understand that for every position there is a buyer and a seller.If you are trading short term, you want to be going against liquidity(news).
2. *Warren Buffett* quote:  “The *stock market* is a *device* for *transferring money* from the *impatient* to the *patient*.If you are trading long term, you need to be patient and have enough bankroll to cover your positions.
3. Support and Resistance

This determines how much bank roll you will need to cover that position. It can show you where you can enter and take profit.

“Palantir Tried Buying Morgan Stanley's Stake in Value Feud
By Lizette Chapman  and Sonali Basak
November 14, 2018, 11:02 AM EST
Updated on November 15, 2018, 10:22 AM EST
Bank’s mutual funds have repeatedly cut value of small holding
So Palantir sought to buy it back at lower price, people say
Silicon Valley startups sometimes bicker with their investors, but tensions between Peter Thiel’s Palantir Technologies Inc. and Morgan Stanley’s mutual funds are reaching a breaking point.

The banks’ funds have cut their valuation of a minor stake in the secretive data-mining company several times in the last two years, estimating the company’s worth at just $4.4 billion as of September 30. That’s well below the appraisal of several other investors in the firm and just one-ninth the valuation Morgan Stanley’s own bankers predict the company could fetch in an initial public offering.”",2020-12-03 05:20:52
Discussion,Extra tendies from TD Ameritrade,9,k5neoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5neoh/extra_tendies_from_td_ameritrade/,27,1606987946.0,"I've been doing a lot of day trading on TD Ameritrade and I've noticed a rather peculiar discrepancy that has earned me a few extra tendies on high volume stonks, and I wanted to share. Hopefully someone can explain exactly why this occurs, still extra tendies regardless though.


I've noticed this with all of my recent trades:


- When I make an order to purchase shares at 'market', I end up paying a much HIGHER price than the actual market value displayed.


But 


- When I make a purchase using a limit (using the limit provided by the broker based off the current market value at the time of purchase (because I wanna buy asap), not a manually set one), I seem to pay a much LOWER price than the actual market value displayed. 


In addition to this finding, I've noticed


- Whenever I sell shares at 'Market', I end up selling the share at a noticeably higher price than what the displayed market value was at the time of purchase.


But


- Whenever I would try to sell using a limit (again, set by the broker based off the current market value at the time of the sale (because I don't want to wait a bit for it to be sold), not a manually set limit), I end up selling the share at the lowest possible amount closest to my limit. 


***Example:***
(these numbers are estimates, though they closely resemble the original numbers. I just don't have the exact data saved).


Buying at market: 


I was day trading shares of a certain stock, I made an order for 600 shares at market value ($0.781) but when the trade processed, I ended up purchasing the shares at $0.792. This discrepancy led to me starting my trade down $6.60.


Buying at TD's market value based limit:


I was day trading shares of the same stock, I made an order for 600 shares using the base limit TD Ameritrade filled in (based off the current market value)($0.781). When the trade processed, I ended up purchasing the shares at $0.775. This discrepancy led to me starting my trade up $3.60.


Selling at market: 


After riding the wave, I notice the share value starting to hint at decline and I decide to close my position. I make a sell order for my 600 shares at market value ($0.812), but they ended up actually selling for $0.819. This discrepancy led to me closing my position with an extra gain of $4.20.


Selling at TD's market value based limit:


Shredded the 'nar, now I want to close my position and lock in those sweet sweet tendies. I make a sell order for my 600 shares using the base limit TD Ameritrade filled in (based off current market value)($0.812). These shares ended up selling at $0.813, leading to an extra gain of $0.60.


Based off of this example, if I had bought these 600 shares using the TD base limit, and sold at 'Market, I would have an extra tendies gain of $7.80.


Now the case can obviously be made that perhaps the market simply changed during the time it took me to close my position, to which I would agree. BUT I've been experimenting with this ""discrepancy"" for hours, and through over 30 seperate day trades - and my results have remained constant. If it was due ONLY to the market changing, then wouldn't at least a few of the results be reversed?


I'm not an expert by any means and I have no idea why it works in this way, but I was intrigued and wanted to share my findings.",2020-12-03 04:32:26

#**Sector and Industry**

Garmin Ltd. operates in the technology sector under the scientific & technical instruments industry. The industry has seen [appreciated 21.33%](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) in the past year. Garmin has slightly outperformed this growth with [23.61% share price appreciation]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN) in the past year. Annual industry earnings growth is [at 7.22% for the last five years]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) with Garmin significantly outperforming at [21.60% in the same time period](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN).

Garmin is the [second largest scientific & technical instruments company](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=ind_scientifictechnicalinstruments&o=-marketcap) by market cap, second only to [Fortive Corporation](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTV). GRMN’s market cap [currently sits at $22.78B]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN). Garmin makes up around 14% of the industry’s [$168.06B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name).

#**The Company**

Garmin Ltd. offers products in [five main categories](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/profile?p=GRMN): automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. In 2019, revenues were split between the segments as follows:

Segment|Revenue
:--|:--
Fitness|28%
Outdoor|24%
Aviation|20%
Auto|15%
Marine|13%

The COVID-19 pandemic was a positive catalyst in Garmin’s marine, outdoor, and fitness categories. Overall, the Company experience a 19% increase in third quarter 2020 revenue, quarter-over-quarter. This is exceptional growth, especially considering Garmin’s exposure to aviation.

As of the Company’s [third quarter 2020 earnings call](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf), marine revenues increased 54% quarter-over-quarter on increased consumer interest in boating and fishing. Garmin’s fitness segment saw a 35% increase in revenue from its wearable and cycling products. Notable, Garmin recently launched the [Venu Sq smartwatch](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/707174). The Company’s outdoor segment saw revenue increases of 30% with strong sales increases for the [adventure watches](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/outdoor_recreation/adventure-watches/c12520-c16900-p1.html) product line.

Garmin did see decreased revenues it its automotive and aviation operations due to the affects of COVID-19. Automotive revenues decreased 6% in third quarter 2020, compared with the same quarter in 2019. The Company has introduced several exciting new automotive products, including Garmin Catalyst: “[an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf).” In the same quarter, the Company became a Tier 1 supplier for BMW automobiles.

The Company’s aviation segment suffered revenue decreases of 19% due to COVID-19. The Company does not manufacture or sell aircraft itself. However, Garmin does expect aviation sales to fall a further 17%. Increases in owner flown aircraft will help to mitigate some losses. One of Garmin’s most exciting products in the segment is its Autoland technology.

#**Autoland**

Garmin’s Autoland is “[taking the next step towards autonomous flight](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/)” by allowing aircraft to be autonomously landed through a single button press. The Autoland system considers environmental factors, chooses a viable airport, communicates with ATC, and then lands the aircraft on an available runway—all while providing updates to passengers. These updates include location, fuel, destination airport, and arrival time. Garmin’s research into autonomous landing may remind investors of Tesla, which is developing self-driving capabilities. Garmin’s Autoland should not be underestimated—it could become the base for full autonomous flight.

Autoland can only currently be used in emergency situations where the pilot is not capable of landing the aircraft. “Autoland directs the aircraft to a suitable airport nearby for landing based upon a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, weather, terrain, approach, runway and aircraft suitability.”
In third quarter 2020, the FAA certified Autoland for [use on the Cirrus Vision Jet](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/), adding to its previous certifications for the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940.

I spoke with a pilot regarding the Autoland technology. He “expects Garmin's new automatic landing systems will be found in most general aviation TAAs [technically advanced aircraft], in the next decade.” Many pilots around the world share that sentiment, especially during a time of great advancements in autonomous vehicles.

#**Valuation**

Year|Revenue*|EBITDA*|FCF*
:--|:--|:--|:--
2016|$3,018,665|$741,900|$705,682
2017|$3,087,004|$777,691|$660,842
2018|$3,347,444|$882,153|$919,520
2019|$3,757,505|$1,068,560|$698,549

*In thousands of USD; from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/financials?p=GRMN).

Garmin has seen consistent revenue growth in the past five years but the earnings growth is even more impressive at [21.60% annual EPS growth](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company’s consistent EPS growth is indicative of its quality management and sustainability. The earnings growth has been priced into the share price at a [PEG of 3.23](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN). It should also be noted that free cash flows have fallen year-over-year amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company remains fiscally healthy with [just $58.42M in debt and cash of $1.65B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN).

Ticker|GRMN
:--|:--
Price|$118.48
Market Cap|$22.78B
P/E|22.51
PEG|3.23
P/S|5.70
Dividend|2.04%

Still, the Company is fundamentally solid and will likely continue to grow. Garmin currently pays a [dividend of $2.44 per share, which is 2.04% of its share price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company has increased its dividend payout in the [past eight consecutive years](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GRMN/garmin/dividend-yield-history); this makes it a good candidate for dividend growth investors. Garmin will become a dividend champion in the likely case that its payout increases the next two years.

#**Conclusion**

Garmin has seen immense growth in its marine, outdoor, and fitness segments. The Company’s investments in its Autoland product have put it at the forefront of autonomous flying. Garmin is a clear innovator in its industry and will likely continue to outperform the overall market.

I personally believe Garmin’s investments in autonomous flight will make it a leader in the industry, much like Tesla has become in automotive self-driving.

DD,$YY = TikTok + OnlyFans,4,k5lh84,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5lh84/yy_tiktok_onlyfans/,28,1606981409.0,"Greetings fellow autists. Y'all remember Marie Kondo? Japanese woman that gets off to cleaning people's shit up for them? Only keep things that spark joy? Fuck yeah. Well, with all you retards losing money by being balls long PLTR, I figured it was time to help you Marie Kondo your own portfolio. Let's tidy that shit up and spark some fucking Joyy.

Yes I spelled Joyy with two y's. And no big brain, that wasn't a typo. **Joyy ($YY) is your next one-way ticket to the goddamn moon.** Can you do basic math? Great. Neither can I. Do you get slightly aroused at the mere sight of a woman with a pulse? Of course you do. I myself just went six to midnight typing that out. Do you like losing money in the stonk market? Clearly. But I'm here to try to change that.

Congrats on making it this far. Let's get started!

$YY is the largest live-streaming platform you've never heard of. **It's like if TikTok merged with OnlyFans and was a publicly traded stonk**. I'll wait while you buy a few shares on that premise alone.

But it gets better. Much better. Joyy operates two live-streaming services, one is called YY Live and its getting sold to Baidu for $3.6bn. **The other is called Bigo Live and it's one of the top 10 apps in the world with revenues growing more than 130% y/y.** Many of the videos on Bigo are of hot Asian women live-streaming themselves dancing. Nice.

That's still not even the best part though. Galaxy brain question: would you rather pay full price for something or get something at a discount? What if you could get it for close to free? Well, at YY's current price, you're nearly getting Bigo Live for free. Please consult a doctor if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours.

How can that be? This part requires some remedial math skills that you and I both don't have, but alas, we must soldier on.

YY currently has $2.8bn in net cash on their balance sheet. Woah! I didn't know this was a fucking advanced accounting class. Well it is. Stay with me. We also know YY is going to get $3.6bn in cash from Baidu for the sale of YY Live. Lastly, YY is an investor in a company called HUYA that is valued at $750mm.

So... $2.8bn plus $3.6bn plus $750mm is? No, not $420.69 you retard. Try again. It's $7.1bn. Feel free to sit down and drink a sip of water if your head is spinning from all these numbers.

Compare this $7.1bn to YY's current market cap of $7.8bn. $7.8bn minus $7.1bn for everything that isn't Bigo Live is $600mm. There you have it. That's the implied value the market is giving to Bigo Live.

Holy shit right? To quote the great David Byrne from Talking Heads: [you may ask yourself](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=69)...

* Didn't Baidu just pay $3.6bn for YY Live?
* And isn't Bigo Live growing 130%+ while YY Live is barely growing?
* And aren't Bigo Live and YY Live about the same size at $1.8bn in revenues?
* And finally – you may ask yourself – if Baidu is willing to pay $3.6bn for YY Live, shouldn't Bigo Live be valued way the fuck more than that?

**The answer to all of these questions is fuck yes.** Bigo Live should be valued way higher than $600mm but you retards are too busy jacking off and losing money on PLTR to figure it out.

**The other great part about YY is we get to fuck some bears on our way to the moon**. I cannot expressly condone nor condemn the actual fucking of bears, but I can condone the fucking of some short sellers. Muddy Waters just released a short report on Joyy and short sellers piled in like the dumbass lemmings they are. How did YY respond to the short report you may ask? **By giving MW the double middle finger and increasing their dividend by $200mm.** Do frauds usually do that? Hell no they don't.

That's how you fucking spark Joyy in your portfolio!",2020-12-03 02:43:29

3. Many top meme stocks you guys are trading are already independently audited by trusted western auditors. (NIO is independently audited by Price Waterhouse, it says so on their website)

**Current Market Cap**: $1.2B & $7 stock price

Too much to read? Well fuck it, just skim below.

**Products and % of Revenue:**

Current YTD Revenue: $612M

Large Driver ICs (**LDDICS**) - 23.2%; down 6.3% vs Last Quarter)

Small & Med Driver ICs (**SMDDICS**) - 63.2%; up 53.5% vs Last Quarter)

**\[Himax\] Forecast of Products:**

What I really wanted to focus on was their products and future guidance for Q4:

**LDDICS**

\+Q4: Revenue increase high single digits (QoQ)

\+Everyone in school/working at home on their laptops and shit) --> Increased monitor & notebook sales

\-Decline in TVs; As a result of COVID --> massive spike in TV buys from previous quarter so now everyone has a new ballin' TV

\+Himax’s Tcon revenue in the fourth quarter limited by capacity shortage in IC packaging due to competing demands from 5G chipsets is on track to increase by more than 20% (QoQ). This will represent more than 40% increase annually.

\*TCON = Timing controller

More info: [https://www.himax.com.tw/products/other-display-related-semiconductor-solutions/timing-controllers/](https://www.himax.com.tw/products/other-display-related-semiconductor-solutions/timing-controllers/)

**SMDDIC**

\+Q4: revenue expected to increase double digits (QoQ) as demand > supply. Issue: capacity shortage which may not be resolved for a while.

\+Expected to gain market share in 2020 & 2021

\+Company's smartphone TDDI revenue is projected to have a nice double digit increase in Q4

\-Traditional display driver ICs for smartphone after spiking Q3 is set to decline double digit in Q4.

?Company highly invested in AMOLED technology and believes it will be a huge growth engine for SMDDIC business in 2021.

\+Tablet TDDI is ballin'. Increase of up to 80% (QoQ) expected for Q4. Believe it is a tremendous upside as Himax is a leading supplier for all major Android names.

\-Expected decline for tradition tablets QoQ, but still better than YoY previous numbers.

\+Car Panel Driver ICs hit hard by COVID, but recovering as car sales come back. Important to note: Much bigger gross margins on these and gradually bouncing back. More of these new technologies in place for 2021.

**Non-Driver Product Categories**

**WLO**

\-Declined as main customer lost sales, but will continue to produce

\+Still enaging and developing future generation products (ToF 3D sensing, waveguide for AR goggles, biomedical devices, and others)

**3D Sensing**

\+Targeting next gen Android phones

\+Few design wins from China's e-payment market actually, with shipments already starting in Q4

\+Working with customers for industrial robotics, smart door lock and home security, also.

**Ultralow power smart sensing**

\+Himax sees this as huge potential for the total package they hope to offer in the future. Just read the financial report because I'm getting lazy here

**CMOS Image Sensor**

\-Bad capped by foundry shortage, more when this shit ain't happening or gets better, chief

**\[Himax\] Future Guidance (Q4 2020):**

**Net Revenue**: To increase by around 10% (QoQ yet again, if you cucks can't tell by now).

\+This was their highest revenue in a single quarter in the past 12 years.

\+**Gross Margin**: To be around 29%, depending on final product mix. Previous Gross Margin by quarter:

2020 Q3 - 21.73%, 2020 Q2 - 20.96%, 2020 Q1 - 20.63%, 2019 Q4 - 20.57%

\-**Steve's claim #3:** 1.2 BILLION POPULATION WITH ONLY 2% ONLINE PENETRATION

This is a crazy lie to convince people that the market is less mature than it is and therefore we have to keep waiting for JMIA to figure out how not to throw cash into a fire pit.

[https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm](https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm) Internet penetration is 40% in Africa with 530M users. Africa has 212M Facebook users (40% of internet users). JMIA has 6.5M users or 1% of internet users measured as **annual active users.**..lol. AND... obviously what's more telling than pure numbers is that they've spent hundred of millions of dollars in marketing across 11 countries to get these dogshit numbers.

not to mention it's the only ecom stock on earth that reduced GMV during Covid. But wait...they're doing a 'product remix'...lol fucking cunts

anyway point being, we cannot let this brazen attempt at market manipulation stand, and this is the only platform for small retards like us to put some sense back into the market. 

btw...i'm short the stock if you couldn't tell (puts DEC18 @ k=19 & 25)",2020-12-03 00:34:16

\-----Currently the stay at home, the pandemic is a big boost to their business.  As gyms open up, people will go to gyms I know I will. 

\-There are tons of competitors that do the same thing.  Nortic track is their biggest competitor.  there value 7 billion . peloton is 30 billion.  There is little to no differentiation. peloton is 4x their competitor.  NordicTrack is also trying to IPO also, so either nordic track is going to go up to the moon and catch up to peloton, or peloton is going to crash.  or have some consolidation regardless

\-if you go on Facebook right now on buy/sell pelotons, you can get pelotons half off right now from all the impulse buyers of their product. that have buyers remorse.

DD,Dish hopefully loses 160+ channels tonight.,11,k5iiht,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5iiht/dish_hopefully_loses_160_channels_tonight/,25,1606972226.0,"DISH a satellite TV provider. They are up 42% this last month to $36.89. Today their contract expires with Nextar. They have been negotiating and claim Nextar is the devil and is raising prices too high. This could cause exponential customer loss, stock plummet.

Dish also got into a bidding war and overpaid for SPECTRUM wireless contracts they spent roughly 20 bn to aquire. This was earlier in the decade. However, the time is running out and they have yet to produce the build-out requirements for these by the FCC. The march 2020 deadline already passed and the next step is them failing to meet the 2023 deadline. They will face a 72 million dollar penalty should they fail.

The bull case here is that sprint and t-mobile merger failed and that Dish received an upgrade to Buy by some analysis because they predict Verizon may want to purchase these contracts for their network so that t-mobile does not obtain it.

Backstory, I have done work for Dish and they are horrible. Dish loses 671K customers annually. Currently with somewhere around 13.9 million. They also own Sling TV which is terrible and loses large amounts annually. The representatives that enter your home are micromanged into selling a minimum of $34 a job of upcharges on anything from HDMI Cables to full sound systems or smart home devices.

Dish has cut a huge amount of internal and external workforce this year amongst COVID-19 as well as raising the requirements for technicians to sell more. COVID may have brought in more temporary customers but with this blackout and more annual customer loss than their competitors I see this a potential shockwave into bear territory for the company if they fail to make a deal.

Something to keep an eye on, I would absolutely love to throw some PUTS on this one.

Update:
I spoke with “my guy” and he said it’s misleading somewhat. 160 channels is nationwide loss. A given area like Your Town May only lose a fraction of that amount based on what channels are with that provider in Your Town. 
He said it will cost a lot of money as dish then offers free over the air antennas with install (they’re usually like $120?) in this situation to compensate. That could hurt the profit margin depending on how wide of an area and how long this goes for. The customer usually pays $12.99 for locals so each customer receiving one could drop the local pack. 


They have already lost channels 8 and 23, and a couple others before today. I have yet to find out which channels are gone now or how the meeting went. 

Hope to see some gigantic drops on the stonk just because.

Update: “About 5.4 million Dish customers are being hit by the carriage impasse. Nexstar’s station portfolio now includes top markets like LA, Chicago and New York as well as dozens of other cities. Dish has about 9 million traditional satellite subscribers and another 2.5 million on its internet pay-TV bundle Sling TV.”

I've been letting myself in slowly, trying to keep a diverse portfolio, and sometimes taking some small risks like putting a little more on individual stocks etc, that are topical/historically solid, etc. I'm doing okay at the moment, but my feeling is that it's a very unique time in the stock market, where the world is pretty connected into one big thing at the moment. 

Like for me at least, its obvious to be investing in airlines right now as they're low currently and the world will eventually return to normal and even if that's not soon, they are guaranteed bailouts etc. But I feel like that's obvious because of the really weird situation we're in. 

My question: is 2020 and during the pandemic a very different kind of stock market? When the pandemic ends, does trading become more nuanced? Or is actually just because i wasn't in it before, that I didn't notice the more 'obvious' moves.

DD,The Gang Takes on Nat Gas,8,k5hy9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5hy9m/the_gang_takes_on_nat_gas/,19,1606970639.0,"I would like to dedicate this research to the oil trader that made a bill shorting Nat Gas after a hurricane and the kid in my stats class for igniting this idea.

Alright, listen up Fireman, Austismos, Goons, Gigolos, and Spooks alike we are taking on the Global Energy markets today. Skip to comments for TLDR. Our emphasis will be on how US Homes are heated. With patriotism and pandemic numbers in full swing, President-Elect Biden may attempt to slow the US Economy, pushing families into homes. Don’t debate this in the comments, debate if your local sheriff’s department has the funding and resources, and willingness to uphold this.

Let’s begin at your new favorite three-letter agency EIA; our journey with understanding and defining how the U.S. Energy Information Administration defines what makes up our statistics.

* **Residential** sector includes homes and apartments.
* **Commercial** sector includes offices, malls, stores, schools, hospitals, hotels, warehouses, restaurants, and places of worship, and public assembly.
* **Industrial** sector includes facilities and equipment used for manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction.
* **Transportation** sector includes vehicles that transport people or goods, such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, trains, aircraft, boats, barges, and ships.

All global energy markets revolve around these sectors. With Petroleum (Oil for the Canadians) providing roughly 37%, Natural Gas 32%, Renewable 11% (kewk), Coal 11% (Trump 2020), and Nuclear at a dismal 8%. Honestly, side note why the fuck are homes still heated on Nat Gas, Electric and not Nuclear? Idk im retarded. Wait its because Nat Gas and Oil are big swinging dicks in this bracket. For those keeping score that’s +1 for Globalism and Capitalism, Science and Commies 0.

Data is a bit dated ;) at 2015 but it’s the best we got from the EIA

So moving along here you see Nat Gas and Electric as make up about 80% of the market. What provides that you ask?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ut1wcxdp4u261.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=76628660c9fba96d72f3f01ebb405cf83977bb41

Wait first lemme blow this up so we can all see

Ok now, 44% of homes are heated with Natural Gas based energy which is highly efficient only consuming 16% of Nat Gas reserves, while 41% are heated by relying on the power grid; which is powered with an additional 36% of the United States Nat Gas. So in total United States homes consume about 52% of US Nat Gas markets.

Here is an [article](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=45716) from the EIA starting to expect greater consumption this winter than in previous years. Posted Nov. 2, 2020

Within this article, they state we should expect consumers to spend 6% more on their winter bill than last winter. Also, producer costs are down 2% year over year. (lockdowns in cold climates were already in effect, for some of the “winter”)

Moving on to transportation and oil markets, 91% of transportation is powered by oil. Think, global shipping lines, domestic holiday shipping, domestic general goods shipping, and the biggest contributor that provides all of these things, airlines. Personally, I’m staying out of this portion due to a diverse set of market forces acting on global shipping markets. Tanker gang rises up tho.

Screenshot from EIA [article](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/where-our-natural-gas-comes-from.php) is shown above has Texas and Pennsylvania produce almost 40% of our Nat Gas

In conclusion and with the understanding that, United States Nat Gas companies out produce all other nations what are the tickers you want to look at?

EQT- Largest Pennsylvania based Nat Gas producer technical point to price spike maybe $25 EOY (just the start of winter)

PXD- Largest Texas-based Nat Gas producer $160 EOY

XOM- I didn’t look into oil production vs Nat Gas but Texas based. $50 EOY",2020-12-02 23:43:59

Why? Because of all of the PLTR bag holders. Yeah, some of you bought horrendously OTM short-term calls, sure, but some of you were people looking at 400% gains and you held because PLTR to the moon.

I keep seeing a lot of advice posts in here that are all great even if none of you retards are actually following that advice, but one more big piece here. I keep seeing people arguing with intense (and unearned) confidence that stock X will keep going up even though it's already gone up 559% in 6 months, stock Y (usually Tesla lol) kept going up when it was up 690% (see what I did there). But guess what fuckers, these are two different cases.

I know we're all autistic in this sub but people need to have exit strategies. You have to recognize that you've already landed on the moon. When you're sitting on a 400% gain on a very risky run-up, it's extremely unrealistic for there to be no sort of pullback *even if the long-term thesis is still intact*. People are out here playing the lottery but you already fucking hit the lottery if you hit on 400%. Guys, the average return on stocks is roughly 8% historically (when you account for inflation). 400% is like 50x that. Yeah it's cool to post 10,000% gains and shit but you know what else is cool? Walking away with a big gain and not having to be the bottom bitch to the homeless guy who you share the dumpster behind wendy's with.

Loss porns were funny but I keep seeing ""lost my life savings"" or ""gambled on significant margin"" or ""i used student loan payments for this"" and it's really bumming me out.

1. Pick a SOLO theme and stick to your conviction.  
2. Buy calls months out.  
3. Split your buying up into bunches. If you wanted to buy $50k of something, buy $10k to start and buy $5k on every solid bounce in either direction (dip or boost) you see.  
4. Roll calls out a month ahead if shit isn't going your way yet.    
5. Have a target and be willing to pull out once you hit it or at least significantly scale back.   
6. Don't be afraid to walk away if shit clearly isn't working. How idiots stuck by NKLA after the truck rolling video is a good example here. Sure it worked for a little while longer, but the greed got crushed recently.  
  
  
Don't do weeklies unless you don't like your money. Don't follow random advice, it works sometimes it doesn't other times. Stick to your plan. Using OptionsProfitCalculator and other tools to see if it's even worth the risk is a good place to start. Asking yourself questions like is this even possible for this to do what I'm hoping it does - is a good place to start.

But you know that. Your wives BF won't even give you knucks anymore. Hopefully you didn't completely wreck your account. What you need to do now is be smart about how you make your tendies back. There will be a few of you retards who get lucky with some FD's and make it back in two days but thats not going to work for all of you. 

What you need to do now is have a plan and know it might take a bit longer. IF you still believe in either of these companies, I mean actually have good understanding of their business and potential catalysts over the next 3-6-9 months then you should reposition into longer dated calls. You will have a good shot to make most of your money back. But it will take time. Don't hold onto your current piece of shit contracts. They are most likely going to 0. Also consider buying some stock. Again wont pay immediately but these companies can still do 100% moves over a relatively short period (6-12 months) or even faster. 

If your butt hole hurts so bad from this beat that the sight of NIO and PLTR gives your hemorrhoids then it's time to do the above strategy into a new ticker all together. Again don't sit on losers too long. If you can extract value do it, but have a plan before you sell anything. 

Anyway, I'm sure you all bought more FD's and will go bust by Friday. So DM me your wives number so I can take her out to Chili's and get a handjob in the bathroom.

edit: Yes retards NIO is up today but unless you timed the dip perfectly your options are down. Also this move is most likely a dead cat. To protect yourself from a longer dip you need to get further out.",2020-12-02 21:42:55

Ackman also said, likely announcement of target will be in first quarter next year.

So with this info, I am quite sure PSTH will go down to $23 - $24 range in next few days.

My retarded suggestion is as follows:

If you have commons, sell covered calls for Dec / Jan, wheel it.
If you have dec calls, sell it
If you have jan calls, cover it with dec calls or sell it.
If you have march calls, cover it with jan calls.

Again, this is just an opinion from your retarded bro and I thought many times if I should make this post or not, but eventually decided to make one.

Regardless of results, I want to try explaining what SNOW does in layman's terminology so everyone can have an understanding.

I work at a Fortune 100 company, leading a tech team. I've seen a lot of companies start investing in SNOWflake to scale their digital and analytical capabilities. Here's a summary of what they do:

· Snowflake solves for a really important problem in Corporate America's IT, where IT is constantly under pressure to deliver the most value with the least amount of work. 

· Here's an analogy for what SNOW does - imagine you had important customer data that will allow you to figure out who are the most profitable customers (so you can tell your sales reps to focus on those leads first). However, that data is spread amongst multiple tables in different file formats such as Word, Excel, and PDF. You need a simple way to consolidate that data in order to make sense out of it. SNOW enables that - we can take data from multiple sources such as big cloud platforms like Amazon web services and Microsoft, and combine it with internal on-premise data so we can have one consolidated structured / semi-structured data set so all your data scientists can understand how one data point (e.g., age, education level) correlates with profitability.

This is why [salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com/) and Warren Buffet invested in SNOW, because SNOW makes life easy, enable all the analytics that corporations are looking for, and allows partners like Salesforce to overcome any internal IT resource constraints that they are selling their services to. The buzzwords you all hear about from Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, are all reliant on having the right data infrastructure in place. Regardless of how earnings today, this is a long term play if you believe that all corporations are investing in this space. Earnings come out today! 

Hope this helps, I'm curious if others have better analogies or simpler ways to explain the business!

* China (uses half of copper in the world) has recovered from the pandemic fully and has imported record amount of copper this year

* People speculate on EV companies like crazy but regardless of which EV companies end up dominating the market and which ones go bankrupt, copper wins.  Each electric vehicle uses 3.5 times more copper than combustion vehicle.  An electrical bus uses 11-16 times more copper than a conventional bus.   Super charger stations needs copper.  Any green infrastructure will require a lot of Cooper.

Goldman thinks copper price may break the 2011 record by second half of 2022.  https://www.ft.com/content/36fe5230-e24f-4fbf-8690-fd211f655347

So what to buy wise, I looked through a dozen big cap producers and jr miners.  Most  mine too many other metals and some own a lot of copper underground but digging up maybe a challenge for environmental/political reasons.  What's left are FCX, SCCO, and HBM.

Back in 2010-2011 when copper price broken record last, FCX traded over $56 ($23.68 right now), SCCO traded around $46 ($60.38 now so maybe not cheap), HBM traded around $17 ($6.78 now).

I have been buying FCX shares for 6 months, just started buying options last couple days.  Right now I have

* 2000 shares of FCX

* 50 contracts of HBM Jan21 7.5C

* 50 contracts of FCX Jan21 30C

* 20 contracts of HBM July21 10C

Im here today to talk to you about a company Im really hyped up about called **Momentus**.These guys are doing some really awesome shit out here providing last mile services for space transport, implementing new high-efficiency propulsion technologies for inter-planetary travel and shipping, and they’re positioning themselves to be in on the GROUND FLOOR of \*Permanent Space Infrastructure\* and the permanent space economy. These guys rule. This is the **first publicly traded space infrastructure company.**

Dont even fucking kid yourself about this: If human beings dont blow themselves into the stone ages, space is \*i n e v i t a b l e\*. We’re looking at $415Billion in revenue in the space industry currently, with Bank of America projecting the industry to expand upwards of $1.4Trillion in the near future.

As excited as I am about these guys, I’ll do what I can to give you the information I’ve been able to dig up so you can check em out and see if you're interested. I personally think they have some short term hype potential (which I’ll explain later) but Im buying calls now to lock in a price for this company to eventually exercise and hold for the full trip around the fucking moon

**Friends First: Momentus Confirmed Partners**

Currently, Momentus has confirmed and active partnerships or provides services to NASA, Lockheed Martin, and our favorite billionaire meme-lord papa Elon via Space X. They are already confirmed to be participating in the (hopefully) January 14th 2021 first-ever ride share rocket launch in partnership with Space X. They’re launching 4 different times with Space X in 2021 including an already-booked full vehicle in December of 2021 so they are already out there making plans and getting shit moving. Besides these big names there are many others they have current accounts and partnerships with including Global Ground Station, Relativity, Albaorbital, and others. And just as a little sugar on top, [the President of SpaceX prefers the types of space-tugs offered by Momentus over small rockets](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spacex-president-prefers-space-tugs-over-small-rockets-2020-11-18) (wouldnt mind em giving me a lil space tug myself ifyanowutimsayin)

**The Men Behind the Mission**

The president and founder of Momentus is a man named Mikhail Kokorich. This guy was born in Siberia and studied physics in Russia where he finished his degree with honors while simultaneously starting a company. He has formed and headed several successful companies starting at age 19 with one that provided explosives and chemical services to Siberian mining companies. After that he founded and ran a chain of domestic merchandise retail stores, second in size only to Bed Bath & Beyond, successfully scaled and sold one of the largest consumer electronic retail chains as well as one of the biggest timber companies in the world.. He finally moved back to his childhood dream of building a space company. The rest of their team includes people with previous experience in aerospace, propulsion, and robotics as well as others. Plus, Mikhail is Russian and they beat the US into space so he’s already got a leg up. Also, Chris Hadfield (the astronaut that did an autistic David Bowie cover from the ISS) is on their Board of Directors, so thats pretty cool.

**The Company, The Vision, The Mission**

Momentus as a company currently has customers for space transportation services including last mile delivery, payload services that will decrease the costs across the board for launching and developing satellites, as well as fixing those puppies up and refueling them \*while they’re in orbit\*. They have a proven groundbreaking water propulsion technology that is significantly cheaper than any current offerings, is reusable, and is already working since a successful test flight in mid-2019 thats still going to this day. **No pushing the satellite down a hill and turning the camera bullshit here.** They put their money where their mouth is and shot that fucker into space just to prove they could, and its **still going.** Currently they have >$90M of signed contracts and 4 confirmed Vigoride (thats what they’ve named their first model) launches on Space X Flacon-9s. They already have a product roadmap with 3 different models to be offered by 2024 providing both small satellite all the way up to 20,000kg transportation. They will have limited commercial launches starting in the first half of 2021 with full commercial launches going live by Q4 2021. They are compatible with Space X, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, and Relativity with active launch deals signed with all except Blue Origin currently. They’re also in negotiations for over $1.1B of contracts including with NASA and the US government. Companies like Starlink, Amazon, Apple, and Google already have plans to create their own satellite networks and Momentus is the first in line with proven technology to service all of these future plans with big and long lasting tech players. They have a clear path to profitability and >$1B in EBITDA. Lastly, they’re already looking to the future and working on plans for in-space solar energy generation, water and resource harvesting from asteroids and other planetary bodies, as well as all sorts of other cool sci-fi shit that (I hope) humans will be capable of before Im fucking dead.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**Momentus is a bleeding-edge space infrastructure and technology company with a successful and passionate founder, a proven currently-in-space revolutionary water propulsion technology, active partnerships with Space X, NASA, and others, and already have good finances and a clear path to profitability and growth. They’re going public via a special purpose acquisition company with an enterprise value of $1.2B which will later be relisted under the ticker $MNTS.

Momentus was founded by a Russian (the first country in space), already has working partnerships with Papa Elon, and wants to build a future where getting to and moving around in space is cheap, renewable, and profitable. This guys are [going to the fucking moon and back several times on a tiny, water-propellled 🚀 with or without you](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201005408/en/Momentus-Announces-First-Rideshare-Mission-to-Moon), so I’d suggest you grab a seat early and hold on tight

**2/21 20c (to lock in my price, exercise and hold)**

edit\* Apparently gay mods hate good DD, $1.2bn enterprise value mergers, and the entire possibility for human beings to permanently inhabit space cause they banned the current ticker.

Literally even Delta is riding their wave back to life  and have altered flights to deliver their vaccine by storing it in dry ice.

Moderna went up 70% to 170$ and only dipped because of serious profit taking because Merck cashed out at like a 650% gain (i think i saw they made over a billion in gainz)

PFE and Moderna are safe bets. PFE a safer bet. Look at headlines. Literally the governors of California and North Carolina have already said how thankful and blessed they are that they are getting a few hundred thousand vaccines from Pfizer and Illinois is about to follow suit.

PFE literally has a meeting for vaccine drug approval with the FDA on December 10.They are experienced, they are financially secure, and they are already making and distributing the vaccine. UK already approved their vaccine, the FDA will follow suit and PFE will make us serious money.

**Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.** 

1) **Develop software for Grid for trading electricity** \- 

Name is “Autobidder”. The grid you’re currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn’t it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)

Tesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You’ll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere. 

&#x200B;

2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **–** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you’ll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you’re really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet. 

Since Sun doesn’t shine at night, and sometimes it’s cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla’s supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla’s battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla’s Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man. 

&#x200B;

3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage –** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you’ll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn’t buy a house that doesn’t have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future. 

4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs –** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It’s really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it’s up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist. 

&#x200B;

The solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who’d be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that’s that. Tesla will dominate this market which they’re building from scratch. 

&#x200B;

**5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that’s the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it’s laughable generally to even think something like “we’re gonna make our own business software”. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don’t tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )   
   
 

**6)** **Selling Insurance Products –** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance “an auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business”. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you’re a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They’re currently offering it in California only. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines –** As per Elon, he doesn’t expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they’re developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it’s a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They’ve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn’t know anything about vaccines? Well, he’s an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac – a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.   
   
 

**8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles –** Oh no…Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren’t people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they’re building. Don’t tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories –** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn’t exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you’ve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla’s long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn’t Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won’t have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?   
   
 

**10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) –** So we’re talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you’re fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla’s in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn’t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with “better chip” next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla’s range doesn’t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let’s not even talk about compute

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- ""Tesla Dojo""** **-** So this is something the industry hadn’t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   
   
 

**12)**  **Mine lithium –** Hold your horses, it’s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they’ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they’ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they’ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage. 

&#x200B;

**13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries –** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They’re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won’t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla’s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won’t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.

**The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**

Vale has been on a bull run with the rest of the market, the sentiment is that Vale is working out a deal with TSLA over supplying nickel for the car batteries that elon musk is going to be producing; I got to thinking exactly how much will vale be getting in revenue and wanted to crack down on some numbers with some assumptions added in, If tesla is set to manufacture 500,000 cars this year and each battery cost on average 10-12k, we can assume that half if not less is for the materials of producing the batteries and then the rest is either markup or for labor; So taking some rough numbers, 5k$ x 500,000 cars is 2.5 Billion USD for the year.. Good chunk of change! but is it enough to push vale to new highs?

Vale currently trades around $15.50 a share, and looks like it will push around 75 billion in revenue, currently at a market cap of 82 Billion dollars and a net income looking around 20 billion for the year after 4th quarter reports later.

TSLA will definitely add some value, but what valuation would be reasonable to aim for? 100 billion market cap? 120 billion market cap? or perhaps is an 80 billion market cap a fair price as of right now and in the near future.

&#x200B;

I am bullish on this stock, I think that as TSLA grows and the EV market grows, so will opportunity for nickel/iron miners.. But I see road bumps in the near future and would like to get some thoughts on this.

DD,Roblox - A first look into valuation before the IPO,324,k593an,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k593an/roblox_a_first_look_into_valuation_before_the_ipo/,225,1606944071.0,"With news of a Roblox IPO, I decide to dive into this company to see what the hype is about. When Roblox was first brought to my attention, I thought they were some sort of gimmick legos. Full disclosure, I have never played this game, but I did play Runescape many, many years ago. Chopped the hell out of some Yew trees. This makes me not the least qualified to gauge Roblox as a video game, but we are gauging its potential as a stock instead.

   

* Roblox is a global platform where millions of people gather together to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds
* Roblox plans to IPO before Christmas, so we take a look at the rumored valuation of $8bn
* Covid-19 has generated a huge boost to traffic with Daily Active Users ((DAUs)) growing 82%, hours engaged growing 122%, revenue growing 68%, bookings growing 171%, and a large $292.6 mm in free cash flow in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020
* The valuation story depends on Roblox's ability to continue growing once the Covid pandemic is in the rear-view mirror

**Roblox Business and Technology:** Roblox was founded in 2003 and has hit many milestones before the planned IPO launch. The most important recent developments being the Joint Venture with Tencent to establish Roblox China and re-launching Roblox Premium to develop a subscriber base with steadier cash flows.

The Roblox business model is based on the underlying technology and infrastructure that support the 31.1 million average DAUs. Roblox defines a DAU as ""a user who has logged in and visited Roblox through our website or application on a unique registered account on a given calendar day. If a registered, logged in user visits Roblox more than once within a 24-hour period that spans two calendar days, that user is counted as a DAU only for the first calendar day"" [(source: company S-1)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm). 

This business is based on three elements:

* **Roblox Client:** The underlying app that allows users to explore 3D worlds
* **Roblox Studio:** The toolset that enables developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D      experiences and content 
* **Roblox Cloud:** The services and infrastructure that power the platform

[We think this is what Roblox players do, but we can't be sure](https://preview.redd.it/cw6x1j3dwr261.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=351745b196e484eca18f7a959dcc73cddb178c70)

The Roblox platform and the key technology characteristics are as follows:

* Identity: The Roblox avatar system allows users to create and personalize their unique 3D identities. There are a wide variety of character styles.
* Friends: The Roblox Client allows users to connect through various means, including detecting nearby players or meeting in the Roblox world. The social graph created by these connections is stored in the Roblox Cloud. The Roblox Platform supports text-based chat among users sharing the same 3D experience and between users connected through the social graph.
* Immersion: The Roblox platform allows developers to build deeply immersive 3D environments where users can share experiences.
* Low friction: Users have the ability to interact with experiences almost instantly, on most popular      client devices, and from anywhere in the world over existing broadband and cellular networks. When a user joins an online experience, the Roblox Cloud assigns that user to a particular game instance based on the user’s social graph, geographic location, spoken language, and age group. 
* Variety of content: Roblox provides developers with reference material, tutorials, community forums, and analytics to build their creations. **Developers and creators build nearly all of the content for the Roblox Platform.** Once content is built, it can be replicated and shared across multiple experiences giving developers the ability to scale their efforts and make rapid updates. There were over 18 million experiences on Roblox as of Sept 30, 2020.
* Global: The Roblox Platform serves a global audience. In the nine months ended September 30,      2020, developers from over 170 countries and users spanning over 180 countries accessed the platform.
* Economy: Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased.      Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content or by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. 

[Robux, the currency of the online Roblox world, buying options](https://preview.redd.it/ob8nmkdrwr261.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d00a16cb7c44c1d36329ef4692f1d85cd3b309)

**Developer Incentives:** With nearly the entire Roblox online universe being built by the ingenuity of developers and creators, Roblox has developed a system to incentivize natural development expansion.

Roblox currently offers developers and creators four ways to earn Robux:

* The sale of access to their experiences and enhancements to these experiences
* Engagement-based payouts - rewarding developers for the amount for time that Premium subscribers spend in their experiences
* The sale of content and tools between developers
* Sale of items to users through the Avatar marketplace

As users purchase and spend their Robux on Roblox, developers receive 70% of the Robux spent within their experiences and 70% of the items that appear in the Studio marketplace. Creators receive 30% of the Robux spent for their items on the Avatar marketplace.

[ Example of a store from Mining Simulator by Runaway Rumble within Roblox  ](https://preview.redd.it/ll886iywwr261.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=a297ebec391df538a2db9c580294c677a6b2d7c3)

These earned Robux are deposited into virtual accounts where developers can convert Robux into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 1 Robux to $0.0035. In the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020, developers and creators earned $209.2 mm, up from $72.2 mm in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2019. Clearly, the Roblox developers and creators are also benefiting from the massive spike in users on Roblox.

**Current Roblox Business Profile:** When users sign up for Roblox, they can create an avatar and explore the vast majority of experiences for free, although the business model for any experience is ultimately up to the developer. Users can purchase Robux either as one-time purchases or via Roblox Premium, a subscription service billed monthly. 

For one-time purchases, users can purchase the virtual currency through various channels including the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, credit cards, prepaid cards, Microsoft app store, PayPal, and others. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 34% and 18% of Roblox revenue was generated on Apple App Store and Google Play Store, respectively. For operations through both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, Roblox must pay the customary 30% to Apple or Google. 

Roblox has managed to rapidly expand its DAU base. 

&#x200B;

[source: Company and our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/tgm7pzjzwr261.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bea9ab82d310c938dc0fff317a4ecbbb37ba47)

Roblox has grown its DAU count by 94.9% and 96.9% in Q2 and Q3 of this year, respectively. DAUs are up in every geographic region with the Rest of the World segment growth being particularly impressive. However, Roblox acknowledges that this upsurge in growth during the pandemic may not be sustainable when they say, ""We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods"" (source: company S-1).

The growth profile and future look of Roblox as an attractive investment hinges on their ability to keep the surge in DAU growth they've experienced as a result of the pandemic and then continue to grow their DAUs (albeit at a slower pace compared to 2020).

The DAU metrics show that 55.6% of DAUs in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020 are under the age of 13. 

[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/cyhv0lh2xr261.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a85667c88551495acbff9c346b7ea71da5cbdd)

DAUs drive spending, and Roblox has seen the average bookings per DAU increase as well. Bookings are defined as ""equal to the amount of virtual currency purchased by users in a given period of time"" (source: company S-1). Therefore, we can expect bookings to be the most widely watched metric every quarterly earnings release, not revenue. DAUs and average bookings per DAU growth are the primary drivers in our valuation model.

**Roblox Cost Profile:** The major Roblox operating costs consist of 

* Cost of revenue - 3rd party payment processing such as Apple and Google app stores - 12.5% of Bookings YTD
* Developer exchange fees - amount earned by developers and creators on the Roblox platform - 16.9% of Bookings YTD
* Infrastructure - Data centers and technical support - 19.8% of Bookings YTD
* R&D, G&A, and Sales and marketing - 19.8% of Bookings YTD

[source: company and our estimates  ](https://preview.redd.it/j4khoil7xr261.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5e4f1d7614e4ca6a02656ae82fdf655b45cfcbb)

As you can see from the chart above, the Loss from Operations has widened significantly the past 4 quarters. However, this is slightly misleading because the company is cash flow positive and the company has been generating more cash flow, not less.

[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/ub0dbvdaxr261.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=0052285a3da1637689665e1708d86cf482402877)

The reason for this is the method the company uses to recognize revenue vs bookings. On revenue recognition, ""We generally recognize revenue from users ratably over the average lifetime of a paying user, which for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019 was 23 months. Therefore, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of purchases of Robux during previous periods"" (source: company S-1). And bookings - ""Substantially all of our bookings are generated from sales of our virtual currency **which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user**"" (source: company S-1).

[source: Company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/zoad08rcxr261.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3a9d7615a3cf3cbd3f35779c598ddf9e97f9fd9)

**So these accounting losses don't necessarily matter** because the company is free cash flow positive. As we can see in the table of bookings and revenue, revenue as a % of bookings declined from 70% in 2019 to 38.4% and 48.8% in Q2 and Q3 2020 respectively. 

**Roblox Growth strategy:** Roblox is focused on four core strategies in order to achieve growth:

* Platform extension: Roblox is continually investing in the platform including in avatars, experiences, technology, and other social features. These efforts can further drive bookings per DAU.
* Age demographic expansion: Roblox and developers are working on building higher quality experiences      and content that appeal to an older age demographic. These efforts can drive DAU growth as well as bookings per DAU as older people don't have to beg mom and dad for their credit card.
* International growth: The JV with Tencent in China is a testament to Roblox's ability to grow      internationally into new markets.
* Further monetization: Roblox is working with their developer community actively to help improve      monetization. Efforts such as Roblox premium being introduced in August 2019 as well as working with leading brands to build unique marketing opportunities on the Roblox platform can further drive monetization.

**Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming Market:** The MMO market has increased rapidly and has hit over 16 million total players. ([source](https://mmo-population.com/charts/players)) We take a look at the market's growth to get a sense of the growth that Roblox may be able to achieve in the near future and beyond. The total number of players dipped in 2019, but the trend is clear with around a 28.5% CAGR in total MMO players over the past 3 years.

[ Source: https:\/\/mmo-population.com\/charts\/players  ](https://preview.redd.it/1u289h9jxr261.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=42b6b45ae0f250d7b671e39c015c3191a4d818de)

We also take a look at the MMO arguably most similar to Roblox, Minecraft. Minecraft is owned by Microsoft and they have released intermittent data points on the number of active players on the platform. The number of active players on Minecraft has increased from 40 million in June 2016 to 126 million as of May 2020. We have only 5 total data points in this time-frame, but this indicates a 33% CAGR over the period and it has accelerated from October 2018 to May 2020. Can Roblox experience a similar level of growth in active players?

**Roblox Forecast:** The basis of our valuation is Bookings per user growth, DAU by region growth, and expenses as a % of Bookings.

Bookings per User have grown 68.6% and 52.5% in Q2 and Q3 y/y, respectively. We think they continue to grow at a high pace in Q4 and Q1 of next year. However, growth will then decelerate as the populations are vaccinated and people start to live their lives as normal once again, thus removing a tailwind for online gaming.

We have Bookings per user growing 20.6% in 2021, 10% in 2022, 7.5% in 2023, and 5% in subsequent years. For example, this deceleration in each DAU spend gives us a quarterly spend on over $20 a quarter in 2024.

DAUs have grown rapidly during the pandemic, and likewise we expect this growth to decelerate as the pandemic draws to a close. We forecast that Roblox will consolidate its Covid user-base gains, and grow an additional 12.5% in DAUs in 2021, 7.5% in 2022, and 5% every subsequent year. This means that Roblox will pass 50 million DAUs in 2024 and will have close to 60 million in 2030.

We forecast that Roblox's costs and expenses will increase, but as a result of scaling will decrease as a % of Bookings in the future. We anticipate that Roblox will be able to consolidate its cost profile so far experienced in 2020 and will have a cost profile \~60% of Bookings in the future, with the largest contributors to cost being cost of revenue, developer exchange fees, and infrastructure where it is more difficult to create efficiencies through scale.

For some scenario analyses of what the company bookings will be in 2025, we look at different ranges of DAU growth and Bookings per user growth. Roblox currently has averaged 31.1mm DAUs in 2020, and we run scenarios from 22mn to 92mm DAUs in 2025. Likewise, we grow average bookings anywhere from 0% to 17.5% a year. We estimate the likeliest bookings range to be $2.9bn to $5.4bn in 2025, compared to the estimated $1.8bn in bookings for full-year 2020.

**Valuation:** We value Roblox through a Discounted cash flow model with a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8% and a perpetual growth rate of 4%. With these assumptions, we get an equity value per share of around $26.50. With the rumors of Roblox seeking a valuation of \~$8bn [(source)](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/technology/roblox-is-all-but-guaranteed-a-blockbuster-ipo-15496912), we get 114% upside.

Just for fun, we run a scenario where we give Roblox decrease DAUs -5% and give 0% growth in bookings per DAU, while keeping the same cost profile, for the final three quarters of 2021 (when the pandemic winds down). We then grow at an anemic rate in DAUs in the future, 5% in 2022 and 2.5% a year onward, we get a price target of \~$18.30 and an equity value close to $12bn.

**Risks to our View:**

Younger audience: With 55.6% of DAUs under the age of 13, how likely is it that they stay on the Roblox platform, we don't have a definitive answer. Kids so young move to the next hottest game very easily and quickly and therefore it is crucial that Roblox continue to capture and keep their attention in order to grow their DAU count.

MMO gaming market competition: An extension of the first risk, the MMO gaming market is incredibly competitive and Roblox will need to continue to innovate and develop its platform to stay ahead of the competition. We aren't aware of any new releases that directly challenge Roblox's position as one of the most widely played games in the world, but new video games and revamps of old games happen all the time. We look forward to seeing how Roblox continues to differentiate itself in the gaming market from competitors and whether these efforts will be successful.

Inability to consolidate Covid user-base gains: Once the pandemic ends will the majority of DAUs gained no longer play Roblox or play/spend less? Our model assumes that the company is able to keep the majority of its DAUs and continue to grow, but this is truly a risk without a real precedent.

**TLDR;** This stock has a very positive story and a lot of price upside if Covid-induced growth can be consolidated and future growth can be achieved. We look to the pricing of the IPO.

This is the last coffin in the nail for NKLA, they are completely done for.

Yet, we hear our lord and savior Paul Coster say this,

{On Wall Street, two analysts who cover Nikola disagreed on what the scaled-down GM agreement means. J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster maintains an overweight rating on the stock.

""We think this is a positive outcome for Nikola over the medium to longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck initiative and avoid the distraction and [capital expenditures] associated with the Badger,"" Coster said in an investor note.}-[link.](https://pub.webull.com/us/news-html/3de4184e223f46448f8f09bdf66a2e4e.html?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&_v=1&theme=2&color=1&hl=en)

In October he said this,
{J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster calls it “a compelling strategy.”However, Coster also points out Nikola’s near-term success hinges on GM signing on the dotted line.“We think the GM partnership deal is the most important near-term catalyst,” Coster said. “Failure to consummate the GM deal would be a fatal blow for the Badger initiative, but a serious blow to the more important Truck initiative too, in our view. The fuel station partnership announcement is less important, in our view, though a potential validation of the company that could resonate with investors. Pending completion of the five Nikola Tre trucks could be a boost to credibility, obviously… For now, the GM partnership is a stress-test for the company.”Coster remains positive on Nikola and keeps an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a bullish $41 price target.}-[link.](http://www.shippipedia.com/nikola-stock-will-surge-70-from-current-levels-says-analyst/)
Did you just read that? He has a price target of $41. 

Again, what he said yesterday kinda completely contradicts with what he said in October.

2 years ago he have had such a [low rating(screenshot of a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/kTSmcxW) that I find it surprising that he has almost come to [3 stars.](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/paul-coster)

Of course, he probably has inherent interest to see NKLA go above its current price. For this he doesn’t give a f**k if people buy into his arguments and jump on board on this stock.

I guess he wants just a dead cat bounce so that he could save his ass and make sure that retail investors become the ultimate bagholders of this company.

There are many other analysts like that in the Street and I don’t know how they remain in business for so long. But my main point is that be careful before you jump into a stock. 

Some of you probably just see an average analyst price target, see a stock is undervalued or overvalued and jump to trade it. I mean according to analyst estimates NKLA would be a kind of a good deal in this overvalued market. But we all know that this company's stock is ultimately going to $0(probably within next year).",2020-12-02 15:48:04

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.

Over 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)

The biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)

Here are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.

While [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.

This news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.

Well yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.

On the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.

The company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.

Slack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.

We also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.

While on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.

But we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.

The biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don’t disappoint.

I greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.

Discussion,$BB trade idea. A theta gang approach.,29,k57u6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k57u6e/bb_trade_idea_a_theta_gang_approach/,10,1606938620.0,"Here’s my plan on how I’m gonna trade $BB. The post will have paragraphs cause fuck those that don’t use paragraphs. 

So, You see $BB all over the place and feel like FOMOing into calls. Here’s a better approach.

Instead, I’m going to sell a cash secure put or even sell it on margin (since the margin requirement are trivial, TD requires $75 margin!) at the $7.5 strike for the Jan 15th expiration. 

It was trading yesterday at $160, probably lower at market open today since BB is up 18%. Maybe even consider the $9 strike.

The reason being is that the IV is skyrocketing; currently at 130% and IV rank is at 60% meaning that this current level of IV is higher than 60% of the historical IV in the past year. 
Let’s see what the maximum gains and potential risks are:

If BB continues ripping, the put will expire worthless and i get to keep the credit and return about 200% on margin held.

If BB stays flat, the IV will crush ( known as reverting to the mean) will tank the premium of the puts which then i can buy back cheaper. 

If BB goes bankrupt and trades at $0 (unlikely but let’s assume maximum risk), max loss would be ($7.5-$0)*100= $750. 
But credit received is about $160 in credit, so $750-$160= $590. That’s the maximum loss in case BB goes to zero which isn’t gonna happen.

TLDR; instead of buying calls and paying for the insane IVs to subsequently get fucked by IV crush, sell a cash secured put.",2020-12-02 14:50:20

May get killed in the Senate unless the dems win the GA Senate runoffs in January which is a possibility especially with the Trump supporters wanting to boycott the GA runoff elections as they feel disenfranchised with Trump's loss in GA.  

On top of which, Mexico's senate voted to legalize weed last week and they need to make a decision by 12/15 so there's another vote in the lower chamber this week or next to make it happen.

And Thailand recently legalized it (like last week!)  Why is that big?  Because ASIA is huge!  Where do you think we shipped all of our cigarettes after it became unfashionable here in the states?

And, ""The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) on Wednesday accepted a World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to remove cannabis and cannabis resin from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.""

It's already totally legal in 15 states, medicinally legal in 20 more, and decriminalized in 10 more beyond that.  https://disa.com/map-of-marijuana-legality-by-state

When someone tells you to buy a stock without a large DD to help their argument **do not buy.**

 **The 25% sell-off in Nikola on Monday represents a good buying  opportunity for investors as the company is no longer distracted by its  Badger pickup truck, JPMorgan said.** 

 **""We think this is a positive outcome for NKLA over the medium to  longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck  initiative,"" JPMorgan said.** 

**NIKOLA TRE**

**Financial Times and Wall Street Journal** both confirmed the rumor that Nikola signed a contract with Romeo Power to use their batteries in the Tre 

The Tre is the only way they have to get something on the road. They have NO working technology. They don't have a proper chassis, so the Tre uses an Iveco chassis. They have no battery so they are stuck white labeling Romeo modules in a horrendous pack design. 

 So, a little background on battery design. When you are designing a battery you have two separate things that you have to account for: capacity, which gives you range, and voltage, which allows you to provide necessary power. You get both of these by connecting together cells. 

 There are two different ways you can connect cells: In parallel, which increases capacity while keeping voltage unchanged, or in series which increases capacity AND voltage. An automotive scale battery will have cells connected in parallel and then those groups in series. 

 The problem comes when, like Nikola, you are stuck using off the shelf modules: For these, the cell groups are already set for you and you are stuck with them. If it isn't what you need for your battery design, you're stuck. This is why custom battery design is crucial. 

 In the case of Nikola, the Hermes modules they are using from Romeo Power have a capacity of 10 kWh and have a voltage of about 100 V when topped off.  To power their truck, they need 800V, so that's 8 modules connected in series. 

 But this sets the capacity for them: 8 modules of 10 kWh each comes out to 80 kWh. While that is a great number for the passenger vehicles that Romeo presumably designed these modules for, it isn't nearly enough for a semi truck. The Tre needs 720 kWh 

So they need 72 Hermes modules. But they can't just put them in series or the voltage will be 7200 Volts, far too much to be safe in an EV. So it is impossible to properly design a battery pack using these modules, and Nikola was forced to improperly design one. 

**NIKOLA TWO**

It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph 

Nikola Two For those who don't know, that's the two trucks that they had Bosch design and build for them a couple of years ago. 

He claimed that it could do 0-60 in under five seconds, when anyone could see it took at least 10 seconds. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb_logo)

1. The range extender power was dramatically reduced. 

2. The battery was made smaller, which not only decreases electric range but also available power.  

3. Nikola most likely replaced the power cells of the One with energy cells in the Two.  

4. They replaced the two speed transmission with a single speed.  

Two speed gearboxes are hard, so Nikola just dropped it. Now, you would be able to make up for the loss of the second gear by just cranking up the power (this is Tesla's approach) but instead Nikola REDUCED the power. The result is this hapless machine that can't go on the road. 

Nikola spent two or three precious years making an utterly failed design that they can't do anything with except creep around the parking lot with guests while they shout above the howl of the radiator fans.  

The truck is worthless. Completely road unworthy, by their own admission. It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph. No wonder it's parking lot only. 

There is ONE time we did see the Two driving kind of fast. It's in a video called, predictably, ""Nikola Two in Motion"". The video description is almost a word for word copy of that of the famous video of the One rolling down the hill. 

**TLDR:  Nio was trading at 7 dollars with actually technology and vehicle sales earlier this year, so nikola should be valued at penny stock status.  just my opinion due to risks of being** ***delisted due to defrauding investors.***

DD,From the Scientist who posted the NVAX DD: Updates about recent COVID Vaccine news and today's price action for $NVAX & $MRNA,96,k5464b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5464b/from_the_scientist_who_posted_the_nvax_dd_updates/,43,1606920061.0,"I've gotten numerous questions about what to make of the last few trading days for $NVAX, as well as $MRNA and $BNTX so I thought it might be useful to give an update on recent developments in the COVID vaccine race and how I'm interpreting them. 

I've already made two long posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/)) about why I think NVAX is the best vaccine stock and as of today have over 60k invested in stocks/options (proof at the end) so I'm not gonna try to pretend that I'm not biased towards NVAX. 

But with that in mind, I still thought this might help NVAX/MRNA/BNTX holders because I think the next month is gonna to be crazy for all three stocks (less so PFE/JNJ/AZN) and I don't know of too many good sources of information for the typical retail investor.

&#x200B;

**Today's action**

https://preview.redd.it/klvnkgq07p261.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=764ddb3dca038a8382c83f4baf5e7724b3659498

I think today was just a pullback from the big moves over the last few days bc I couldn't find anything that would have cause all three stocks to drop. Please let me know if I'm missing something.

Although all three stocks followed the same pattern at the start of the day, MRNA's selloff seemed to accelerate right around 12:30pm, which coincided with an interview of Moderna's President Stephen Hoge as part of the Evercore ISI annual health conference ([webcast link](https://wsw.com/webcast/evercore11/mrna/2356374); requires name and email to view video). I don't know if the two things are related, but comments he made during the interview were picked up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b4nj6sfv9p261.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e35b8a2b3b91782bb2e12fc2d3b145118111bd2

Whether or not I'm overinterpreting the two events, there were a couple of important things that came up during the interview that might be of interest for MRNA holders:

1. In my first post, I talked about how the 95% efficacy for MRNA that's been widely circulated only refers to prevention of symptomatic disease and not prevention of infection. Well this was the opening topic and I wonder whether this was the first time some people realized that the reported 95% efficacy didn't refer to infections and prompted an overreaction. I think Hoge did a good job in navigating the questions and made it clear that they'll be reporting that data as a secondary endpoint from the trial.
2. Manufacturing capacity was another big topic and Hoge said that the upper end of the 500M to 1B doses they're estimating for 2021 isn't going to happen unless everything goes perfectly. He said that the 500M estimate was more reasonable and to my ear seemed to be hedging quite a bit, making me question whether 500M is going to be difficult to achieve.
3. They expect to have 20M doses by the end of the year
4. No safety issues have been observed and we know that the vast majority of safety issues with other vaccines present within the first few weeks (can't remember the exact timeframe).

&#x200B;

[This](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2s) was the only other thing that I could find that may have impacted NVAX/MRNA/BNTX:

https://preview.redd.it/b2eqpfyvdp261.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d371b1d37789aaac21b5e1ab1d0cbe0d999242

I haven't spent a lot of time talking about JNJ, as their Phase 3 trial was halted in October due to a case of transverse myelitis and everything I've read suggests that they're not going to be able to apply for emergency use authorization until mid-1Q 2021. I have to get more caught up on JNJ to figure out the implications of their progress, but my impression until now has been that they're behind. That however might not be the case outside of the US, and if so, maybe this news was relevant for NVAX/MRNA/BNTX. I'm skeptical bc I saw almost zero discussion of this, but I think it warrants some consideration. 

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Important Upcoming Catalysts

&#x200B;

**Emergency use authorization announcements**

https://preview.redd.it/46ib0ermgp261.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4277928982b4a55ee00ae31a97ce48ae26610db

[Link](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article247526955.html). I think this is just an attempt to reassure the public that they're not going to take any shortcuts. I think it's extremely unlikely that both of the mRNA vaccines don't get emergency use authorization given their high efficacy rates and reportedly good safety profiles in the middle of a pandemic. We'll know based on the AdComm meetings on December 10th for PFE/BNTX and December 17th for MRNA. 

This is obviously a positive catalyst for MRNA/BNTX, but I have no idea how much they'll run-up to the announcement and how much of them getting approval is already priced in. As far as how this impacts NVAX, I think we might see a small pullback if positive announcements but I honestly have no idea what will happen. I tend to think this won't matter much for NVAX since it's been clear for a long time that they're behind PFE/MRNA.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Reactogenicity of mRNA vaccines** 

Something that I think is completely off the radar but I think is going to be a huge deal within the next month is the fact that mRNA vaccines have significantly more reactogenicity than the vaccines most people are used to. Reactogenicity includes symptoms like injection site pain, swelling, fever, and fatigue; symptoms that are unpleasant but not dangerous. 

If you're an investor in MRNA/BNTX, don't shrug this off. This [article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1022) published in Science is what convinced me there's trouble ahead and this can't be ignored:

https://preview.redd.it/3x3lxf9klp261.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a89fca405b51b1bafcb3e9fccebd11f870bbd39

Here are a couple of quotes from the article:

&#x200B;

>... after the second injection, his arm swelled up to the size of a “goose egg,” ...  within a few hours, Hutchison, who was healthy and 43, was beset by bone and muscle aches and a 38.9°C fever. “I started shaking. I had cold and hot rushes,” he says. “**I was sitting by the phone all night long thinking: ‘Should I call 911**?’”   
>  
>  
>  
>Hutchison's symptoms resolved after 12 hours. But, he says, “**Nobody prepared me for the severity of this**.” He says the public should be better prepared than he was, because a subset of people may face intense, if transient, side effects, called reactogenicity, from Moderna's vaccine. Some health experts agree.   
>  
>  
>  
>“**Somebody needs to address the elephant**: What about vaccine reactogenicity? While it's … not going to cause any long-term issues … how is that perception going to go with the public once they start receiving it?” asks Deborah Fuller, a vaccinologist at the University of Washington, Seattle, whose lab is developing second-generation RNA vaccines against COVID-19. She worries the side effects could feed vaccine hesitancy. “**I feel like it's being glossed over**.”   
>  
>  
>  
>Most people will escape “severe” side effects, defined as those that prevent daily activity. Fewer than 2% of recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines developed severe fevers of 39°C to 40°C. But if the companies win regulatory approvals, they're aiming to supply vaccine to 35 million people worldwide by the end of December. **If 2% experienced severe fever, that would be 700,000 people.**   
>  
>  
>  
>Hausman also sees a need to support people who have serious reactions. **For example, people may need “a hotline with a nurse triaging …** **figuring out if you need to go to the hospital or not. Will your medical expenses be covered if you do?** These are important questions.” 

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to contribute to fear mongering or indirectly help my NVAX investment by highlighting this (although these issues are part of what made me invest in NVAX in the first place). That's all from an article published in Science which would be one of the last sources that would ever be interested in reducing vaccine acceptance.

The bottom line is the US, vaccine skepticism and misinformation - particularly about COVID vaccines - is higher than ever. What's going to happen once the people being injected aren't clinical trial participants and instead include people that are reluctant/skeptical? Even if the rate of severe reactogenicity is only 1%, that's going to be a lot of sources for news stories ""about new untested mRNA vaccines"" and a lot people sharing horrible experiences on social media if millions get vaccinated. 

I think this could hit BNTX/MRNA hard if it becomes a big story line. Still probably some gains to be had in the runup to the EUA announcement, but I would be real careful if I was holding options once we get further into December and the probability of this as a story line increases.

&#x200B;

**NVAX + Positions update**

Assuming the below screenshot supposedly from JPM is [real](https://twitter.com/MaxSpeculation/status/1333956816187875328/photo/1) (I can't find the original source), NVAX lowered the interim update trigger from 66 events to 50 events in their Phase 3 UK trial, which means we'll get the interim update sooner that what was originally stated in the clinical trial protocol. Their head of R&D said they'd do this last week, so I suspect this is legit but no guarantees.

In case you're not familiar, the interim update is when we'll get the first readout on efficacy. If it's good (90-95%) then I think the stock goes up massively. So I'll be holding through that announcement pretty much no matter what happens from here on out. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qfzjp8efxp261.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=69fd7eab831c142ce03165be381c891ee54b00e8

&#x200B;

If you're holding options that expire on December 18th, then I might consider rolling them to January bc it will be cutting it close. My plan is to actively trade the December options and keep building my core position in January calls so I give myself enough breathing room for the announcement in case it doesn't come in December. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ojhduf3vtp261.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f7aed5054f1965cc9881274087cca2b06ec6782

I rolled a lot of gains from the last few days into these positions, so even though today I gave a lot back, I'm still up significantly since I started this trade. The reason for the weeklies is that NVAX has a couple of investor meetings coming up in the next two days and I think this rebounds.

Here are my reasons:

•It will eventually be an operating system ( like Microsoft :[Link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch) )

•It is backed by a billionaire

•It is backed by the US government

•This entire community loves the stock(mostly very rich people)

•They just signed a $300 million dollar deal… it’s on the website, is that reflected in the financials?If it is not, then I think the price needs to go up to adjust for that (asking not telling)

""They're all going to dump lidar,"" Elon Musk said at an April event showcasing Tesla's self-driving technology. ""Anyone relying on lidar is doomed.""

""Lidar is really a shortcut,"" added Tesla AI guru Andrej Karpathy. ""It sidesteps the fundamental problems of visual recognition that is necessary for autonomy. It gives a false sense of progress, and is ultimately a crutch.""

But also a bunch of companies are using it, considering even the fucking army uses it:

""by combining the laser range, laser scan angle, laser position from GPS, and laser orientation from Inertial Navigation System. Additional information about the object, like its velocity or material composition, can also be determined by measuring cert""

Again i have shares in LAZR and i am probably going to sound biased but who is right here?

Papa Elon has never steered us wrong, but the might dick of the US Army hasnt either.

In my honest opinion, i feel that LiDar is in its infancy, and even if Papa Musk is right, LAZR can sell their tech to other industries like air travel/space/defense

CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) has been on fire as the world has been on fire due to COVID-19. This company has been doing so well this past month or so. The KEY thing here is that there are only 7...I repeat 7, Antigen tests for COVID-19 worldwide. Not in the US...worldwide. And CEMI has submitted their approval for a rapid antigen test waiting to be approved by the FDA for EUA.

Highlights of what you have missed since my last post:

* 12/2/2020: Chembio Diagnostics Awarded $12.7 Million by BARDA for Development of Rapid DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel and 510(k) Submission of the Rapid DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System
* 11/13/2020: Chembio received regulatory approval from Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) to market the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System in Brazil.
* Craig Hallum upgraded CEMI as a buy today for $10 PT

That BARDA contract that they won will enable them to create a new test that looks at both Influenza A/B and COVID-19 with their DPP test.

On top of that, they have their 2 tests submitted with the FDA for EUA, the antigen and antibody test. The second those are approved, which is imminent, this thing will skyrocket.

Still long those original shares I posted at the bottom, but added 2000 additional shares on one account and 2500 on another account.

**----Previous Post on 10/16----**

Listen up here you degenerates...its time to do some due diligence on CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) and make some sweet tendies with it. Chembio is a leading point-of-care diagnostics company focused on detecting and diagnosing infectious diseases who have recently also gotten into creating tests for COVID-19. Here is why I think they are going to skyrocket:

* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System - Rapid Test Provides Results in Only 20 Minutes (Submitted Oct 15, 2020) ---- BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) has given Chembio their support throughout the development of the antigen system so there is is skin in the game here.
* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for New DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Test System - New Antibody Test System Provides Results in 15 Minutes from Finger Stick, Venous Whole Blood, Plasma, or Serum Samples (Submitted Sep 8, 2020)
* Chembio just received FDA Approval for DPP HIV-Syphilis System on October 2, 2020. The system includes the DPP HIV-Syphilis assay, a multiplex single-use test, and the DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer, and is being offered in the United States immediately.

Their platform, DPP, can flex into multiple different areas, and with a recent approval for their HIV-Syphilis test, as well as they are on the fast track for approval for their COVID-19 tests, this will be huge. Now what I will say is there share price went to \~$15 when they released their COVID-19 test, but it didnt show good results so the FDA removed their test from the market and caused the shares to tank. But thats ok, because the new CEO has his head on right and will get this done in the right way, especially with the funding from BARDA.

Any partnership, any approval from the FDA, and this will skyrocket. I am long on 6000 shares @ \~$4.62.

Good luck homies and as always, do your own due diligence to get those sweet tendies.

TL;DR: CEMI target share price of $15+",2020-12-03 17:53:00

(DXCM) and Why I BOUGHT THE DIP and YOLO’d 80k.,39,k5yf5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5yf5i/diabetic_due_diligence_on_dexcom_inc_dxcm_and_why/,54,1607035335.0,"As you autists know, BUY THE FUCKING DIP. For the last few months, I have watched this sub decay into exclusively meme stocks, SPACS, EV, GYNA companies, Weed stocks, and a government backed Skynet. Instead of presenting real buying opportunities, WSB has been filled with pump and dumps and shit stocks. This is not that, this is a real market opportunity to make gains by BUYING THE FUCKING DIP. This DXCM dip has been completely overlooked by WSBets...because once again, you're all fucking degenerate autists. I know this because I am too, I participated in many of the swings and after breaking my neck a couple times, the whiplash caused me to do my own research and fall back on the most basic principle BUY THE FUCKING DIP.

I believe so strongly in this position that I have YOLO'd $80k into DXCM calls. You can see my positions and my ass at the bottom of this post.

Now my analysis of DXCM is broken down into 7 parts: The Product and Increasing Market Share, \~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~, price targets, Revenue, Earnings, Partnerships, Competition, COVID impacts, and most importantly THE DIP. This post is pretty long, but the TL;DR is that this company is recovering quickly from a massive dip, dominates the market, and presents a great tendies taking opportunity.

**The Product and Increasing Market Share**

DEXCOM is undoubtedly the best diabetes management device in the market and their market shares continue to grow as more Type 1 diabetics are switching from syringes and finger pricks to insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors.

Dexcom is currently the market leader in continuous glucose monitors. If you don't know what a continuous glucose monitor is, simply put, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) tracks glucose levels throughout the day and night and can alert Type 1 Diabetics if their levels go too high or low. CGM systems take glucose measurements at regular 5 minute intervals, 24/7, and translate them into dynamic data to show glucose direction and rate of change. Dexcom CGM tracks glucose levels continuously throughout the day and night, while simultaneously sending glucose readings to the user's smart device or receiver every five minutes. Dexcom CGM then translates readings into dynamic data so that Type 1 diabetics are better able to manage treatment.

**\~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~**

**Price Targets and Strong Buy Recommendation** \- Avg Price Target of **$445.60**, Currently trades at $334

DXCM is currently trading more than $100 under its price target and is closing the gap rapidly as it recovers from its recent November dip. See the Analyst Consensus Rating below:

[AVG. PRICE TARGET $445.60](https://preview.redd.it/jceur9o6su261.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2c196f05dfd7bdf3444e42aa3066d4ac15e4b1)

DXCM is currently rated as a Strong Buy by almost all analysts.

[DXCM = Strong Buy ](https://preview.redd.it/g6x9gc0e8v261.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e967ca9c66ade9770a0419e6ab244a4c2114490)

**Steady Revenue Growth, Balance Sheet, and Growing Market Share -** Dexcom Revenue continues to steadily climb and just passed half a billion last quarter with positive cash flow on its balance sheet, a growing market share, and an increase in Continuous Glucose Monitor users worldwide.

[Continued Revenue Growth ](https://preview.redd.it/g031y7q60v261.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f86e4f844f99fb49e1d4d8ac09ece7ace2acdd)

**Earnings -** Dexcom does not miss on earnings and has consistently beaten expectations by wide margins. I expect they will continue to do so next year as more diabetics get back to regular endocrinologist appointments. See the graph below:

[DEXCOM ALWAYS BEATS EARNINGS](https://preview.redd.it/u6vuq1vfzu261.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e50be2755bc34b313d7dd6fafa0e2f480997fc9)

**Key Partnerships -** From Wikipedia - ""[Tandem Diabetes Care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Diabetes_Care) received FDA approval in December 2019 for Control-IQ, a closed-loop technology that uses Tandem's t:slim X2 insulin pump and the Dexcom G6 to ""to automatically increase, decrease, or stop the delivery of insulin in response to the glucose levels of people with Type 1 diabetes."" Dexcom entered into a partnership with Livongo, a digital chronic care management company, in January 2020 to share CGM data from the Dexcom G6 with Livongo’s platform. This integration will allow Livongo to incorporate the CGM data along with other patient data to provide health insights based on its algorithm to help patients manage their diabetes. In February 2020, Dexcom and Insulet Corporation signed a non-exclusive, global agreement to combine current and future Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring systems with Insulet’s tubeless insulin delivery Pod into the Omnipod Horizon™ System for automated insulin delivery. This will give the ability to adjust insulin doses based on Insulet’s algorithm or through their smartphone. The company also announced in March 2020 a partnership with Welldoc to integrate G6 CGM data with BlueStar, a digital platform for diabetes management. BlueStar will combine the CGM data with information on patients' activity, nutrition, sleep and other factors to help them manage their condition."" [\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexcom#cite_note-25)

**Little Competition and Positive Market Sentiment**

There are 3 major players in the Continuous Glucose Monitor market. They are Dexcom, Guardian Medtronic, and Freestyle Libre. Dexcom is by far the most advanced, accurate and used device of these three. I will try to highlight the main advantages of the Dexcom over the competition, but I highly recommend you look into the reviews and research around the accuracy and features of these devices. The points below are from SugarMDs - [https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:\~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently](https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently)

1. Dexcom has nightime monitoring for increased safety - ""One of the biggest risks that a person faces is highs and lows while they are sleeping. A Dexcom G6 and Guardian Medtronic (but not Libre) CGM system can monitor and alert you at night should your blood glucose drops. Unfortunately freestyle libre does not have that feature.  You can also choose to notify someone about your blood sugar levels by sharing your glucose data. The timely warning can prevent you from experiencing side effects related to highs and lows.
2. Accuracy - ""Between the Dexcom versus libre, Dexcom appears to be more accurate in the low glucose ranges below 80 mg/dL compared to libre.""
3. No finger pricks - The dexcom, unlike Guardian Medtronic which needs to be calibrated at least once every 12 hours, does not require any finger pricks to calibrate the device. This saves patients hundreds of dollars on test strips and is one of the best features of the device behind it's accuracy.
4. Customer Service, Reputation, and Retention - Top of the line customer service that is dedicated to serving patients. ""If a sensor stops working or doesn’t insert correctly, tech support is easy to get a hold of. After a few questions, they will replace a sensor that does not work. They might even send two."" [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre)

&#x200B;

**COVID Impacts**

1. COVID created increased awareness of the importance of monitoring underlying conditions. I believe this will be a huge driving force behind growing revenues and market shares for Dexcom. Diabetics are now, more than ever, acutely aware of the need to monitor their Diabetes closely and Dexcom is the best product for that.
2. Increased Dexcom orders as patients return to quarterly endocrinologist appointments. Although, Dexcom beats earnings every quarter, I believe they will have even larger beats in 2021 as more patients transition back to seeing their care providers in person and will be able to see the products for themselves in medical offices.

**Buy the Dip - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT**

In November, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen slashed his 12-month price target on the stock from $420 to $350. Biegelsen cited increased competition and pricing pressure in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) space following the approval of Abbott Labs' Freestyle Libre 3 CGM in Europe. Abbott's CGM system is reportedly priced at $1,066 per year, whereas DexCom's G6 device runs about $2,496 per year.

This slashed price target was unjustified and the Analyst Consensus Rating above confirms that with an average price target of $445.60. It was unjustified for two specific reasons.

First, there is major consensus and sentiment among diabetics that Dexcom is the most accurate continuous glucose monitor on the market justifying its higher cost (See here - [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre) or look at r/diabetes_t1 to get a feel for the love that surrounds the Dexcom and the impact that it has on the lives of Type 1 diabetics).

Second, the pricing differential did not justify such a drastic price slash. This is because for an ever growing number of patients insurance covers the cost of these continuous glucose monitors so price isn't a factor as diabetics always hit their deductibles due to insulin costs. Additionally, people do not skimp on price or often choose the cheaper device when it comes to their health. The reliability and accuracy of the Dexcom justifies its higher price. It's the best on the market and diabetics know it.

Anyway, as you can see from the graph. The stock has dipped from $420 to around $320 in the past month, but is quickly picking up momentum back towards the average analyst price target of $445.60. Moreover, pre-COVID the stock was trading at $456.23 and will likely blow past its ATH over the next year.

[Dip to $320 in Nov. Currently Rebounding back to $400+](https://preview.redd.it/8gla7g5dpu261.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4d0c429c14096253284c6b447f67e012f4fac4b)

**The Play**

I think this stock will run and run fast over the next couple months in anticipation of February earnings and as institutions dump their money back into a stable medical company. I would recommend playing stocks or long term ATM or ORM LEAP calls as DXCM has low options liquidity atm. The idea is to profit from the November dip that I touched on above. I am in for $80k total. I am all in and believe in this position, I would not be posting if I didn't think this was a sure thing. These are the trades:

**1) $5k in DXCM $340c 1/15**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Buy 2021 Leaps on DXCM, they are the best products on the market and currently heavily undervalued and recovering rapidly from a major dip.

**\*Personal Note and Kiss My Ass\***

On a personal note, I myself am a Type 1 Diabetic that uses the Dexcom CGM. I transitioned earlier this year from the Guardian Medtronic CGM and the device has been life changing. It has lowered my A1C levels, made my diabetes incredibly more manageable, and conveniently links with my iPhone and Apple watch which has made it a very enjoyable device to use. I've also attached a photo of my device so you can also get a feel for what the Dexcom CGM looks like and so that you autist fucks can kiss my ass when this play makes you tendies.

Let’s talk about what happened yesterday in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw both the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/sKKNVjr) and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/PzxfrWt) up about 0,2% with the SP closing at a new record high while the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/f909849) trailed and finished just below the previous close, down only 0,05%. We did see a spike in the [VIX](https://ibb.co/QMqhtMv) of almost 2% as this was quite a volatile day with the market dropping at the open before regaining traction in the middle of the trading day. We saw a relatively even market yesterday as 56% of companies were advancing on below average volume as most of the companies continue to trade well above the moving averages. The leading [sectors](https://ibb.co/d0740g8) yesterday were Energy and Financials with Materials and Real Estate lagging the market as [Small and Large Cap value plays](https://ibb.co/hLDgLmm) kept the market positive with companies like Boeing being up [more than 5%](https://ibb.co/b3jRN2s) for the day after good news on multiple fronts like Ryanair [probably](https://ibb.co/8xpKXxQ) acquiring new planes and the [first flights made](https://ibb.co/qmJNkPc) with the new 737 by American.

[STOCK MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/BPVFx2d)

Here is a complete [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TKsdbDn) from yesterday as we saw an even market as I said earlier, with Salesforce being the only big looser in big caps as the stock continued to dive after the Slack news. I think this was a great opportunity to buy the stock in a dip as I doubled my portfolio value on the company from 1,5% to 3% of my portfolio while also getting in [more](https://ibb.co/Pr47Th5) on Boeing, Apple, Netflix and a couple of other companies.

We also got the AAII investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/KxkbTbb) yesterday as the percentage of bulls has increased constantly in the last month. This is usually a very bad sign for the stock market as corrections, consolidations or even crashes occur when people tend be over-bullish. I don’t think this will be the case at least for a couple of weeks, though I think we are poised for a small market correction in the near future before moving on even higher.

Here is the most interesting [economic data](https://ibb.co/PD2XBsn) that will be released today as we get new jobless claims as well as services PMI and ISM. I expect the jobless claims to continue to get worse sadly for the next couple of weeks at least until the vaccine starts to get distributed with ADP November jobs [numbers](https://ibb.co/S6V64xJ) coming in yesterday shy of forecasts and at the lowest level since July, this is not great news for the jobless claims that will pop up early today. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/wQ3mK2b)

\[Later EDIT\] - Jobless claims came in way better than expected : [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/Jscz1SZ)

Great news came in this morning as the US is [expected](https://ibb.co/vYp0LDT) to have capability to immunize at least 100 million people by the end of February, that is great news, as specialist believe a herd immunity can be reached if there are about 60-80% of people either immunized or have already developed natural antibodies.

We also have a couple of interesting earnings [scheduled](https://ibb.co/6nJjrRY) for Today, as I expect Kroger to beat the estimates, though I didn’t get any action on this, I did get some [action](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) on [Marvell](https://ibb.co/34x6mpN) as I bought the stock about a week ago. While I expected Dollar General to do alright and I think we might see some disappointment in [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/BPsz5Mj) just like I thought we would see bad reaction to great earnings with Zoom.

\[Later Edit:

\-Dollar General [reported](https://ibb.co/gJPRpXM) a beat on top & bottom line but did not offer guidance and the shares of the company have pulled back in pre-market trading 1,6%

\-Kroger [beats EPS](https://ibb.co/bgsMckw) by 0,05$ but misses on revenue by $310M, shares down 4% pre-market\]

Alongside Marvell which I expect to beat the estimates of 25cents per share and also beat on revenue, I also [bought](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) Okta which released earnings yesterday and [crushed](https://ibb.co/VmvBzYV) expectations as recurring [subscription revenue](https://ibb.co/nftnckz) grew by more than 40% year over year as well as big increases in operating margins, billings and customers. This led the stock to [spike 8%](https://ibb.co/xzyy0qr) after hours as I will make a good profit on the investment and may even consider holding this position for the long term in the company.

Also, one other staple company from my [portfolio](https://ibb.co/pKbNy8M), CrowdStrike released earnings yesterday and delivered great [results](https://ibb.co/dgyfn8g) as the annual recurring [revenue](https://ibb.co/N6vhWfW) has grown more than 80% year over year while adding over 11hundred new subscriptions this quarter while also improving [gross margins](https://ibb.co/THfGJ2c) by 2%. The company also gave guidance for next quarter way over analyst expectations as that made the [stock soar 13%](https://ibb.co/ZGxbsRx)

The only big disappointment from earnings released yesterday was [SNOWFLAKE](https://ibb.co/6BhYKHC) as they have suffered the same way as Palantir in the first earnings report as analysts were expecting even bigger numbers after the huge rally the stock has had since the IPO. One Morgan Stanley analyst said that they needed to deliver around a 140% growth of revenue to make a good impact on the stock as the company’s revenue only grew up 102%. If it continues to drop it might find the way to a good entry point, but for the moment I believe this price is to high for the company.

We also got news yesterday as the House [passed](https://ibb.co/w0Ly1MP) the billt hat allows Chinese companies to be delisted if they do not comply with new auditing rules, as this measure is expected to by signed fast by Trump.

I think this is good news for investors in the long-run as I don’t believe big companies like Alibaba will suffer from this, with BABA being audited by established PWC Hong Kong auditors, though this might be a bigger problem for smaller companies that are not able to follow the rules. I still believe Alibaba is a great company to buy at this price point as the company has [dropped](https://ibb.co/W283kbG) due to bad news developments in the last 2 months, but I think has a lot of room to go higher, even testing the previous highs of 319$ and surpassing them, especially with this holiday season having great sales numbers.

This news combined with the recent [upgrade](https://ibb.co/c2mwgPc) at Goldman was music to the ears of Tesla investors as the stock rose almost 3% after hours and erased the daily losses.

Other news came as the House is expected to vote on the [MORE ACT](https://ibb.co/RgjnPgY), though this will be surely blocked in the Senate, this is still good news for the cannabis sector as states will likely legalize this way before we can a national bill.

While Palantir dropped big yesterday after Morgan Stanley [warned](https://ibb.co/m4NsSWr) for a negative-risk reward in the stock as the stock has dropped more than 20% in the last 5 trading days, I sold out of my position on Palantir for a 40% profit recently but I may get back in if the price starts to make more sense.

So, with the latest developments, I believe investors should not forget about the FAANG stocks that have brought us back from the depths of the March lows. [FACEBOOK](https://ibb.co/gFd1S5R) still gives small business that will be back when the economy returns the best bang for the buck in advertising, especially with the great platform that Instagram has become.

While [APPLE](https://ibb.co/j4YW4Qy) seems to be doing very well with the iPhone 12 sales and the new 5G cycle while also growing the services business very fast, that will bring them more and more steady cash flows for the company.

Despite missing the latest sub numbers, [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/LJ8fr37), is still producing a lot of great content, has the most subs and the most content available for streaming and I believe they will remain the best in business alongside with Disney+

What can you say about [AMAZON](https://ibb.co/nrD5qnY) as they are a death star for every sector they get in… E-commerce is here to stay, and Amazon still has huge room for growth especially in Europe and Asia.

While [GOOGLE](https://ibb.co/tz2htpn) was the laggard for most of the year, with travel & entertainment returning to advertising, this will be very good for the company, as travel is the biggest advertiser usually.

This companies will remain great owns for the long run, even if they underperform now, which I don’t expect, in the long-run this will remain some of the biggest winners in this new economy.

And don’t forget December is usually a great month for stocks as people tend to not take profits on capital gains at the end of the year, so it is likely that people will keep the winners while also receiving a boost from the stock market Santa Claus effect.

Mine was losing $200,000 in options in 2 week (several weekly expiring calls). So dumb, I can’t believe I did that. I have $400,000 net worth now. (Age 28) So it’s really a big blow. I still have $400,000 but I can’t believe I was that stupid to bet $200,000 positions in options on weekly contract. It’s a lesson. What are your stories? How much did you lose and how much of your net worth was it and how did you end up losing the money? Maybe you have a commercial property and it hasn’t been filled all year because of corona. I can’t think of many ways to lose $200,000 to be honest besides options. Hard to lose $200,000 in real estate, unless someone has before and would like to share? Losing $200,000 in a business might be possible, I’m not sure about business numbers, if anyone has any experience. But yeah, I lost $200,000 in 2 weeks in options. Still kicking myself over it. You live and you learn. That was my get rich try and it failed. I won’t risk that much again and will play it safe now. I could have bought a nice house for rental income with that $200,000 as down payment but I wanted to gamble to be super rich with options with the $200,000 which failed. I still have $400,000 left so I’m fine and playing it safe. Probably invest stocks, rental properties, theta strategy/premiums, and play it safe.",2020-12-03 11:50:43

1. TOMORROW: **Thursday December 3rd 2020 (11:30am EST)** \- Live demo of the Nano-X Arc at the Radiology Society of North America 2020 virtual conference. This demo is going to destroy Citron's fruity ass short claims (Reference all the companies that Citron shorted. Yeah... they're stupid.)
2. Can Happen at ANY moment - FDA 510(K) application in for a single-source device which could get approved ***before*** 1H 2021.
3. Mid-year 2021 - FDA 510(K) approval of the multi-source device, the one planned on being commercialized. This one is the bigger deal and is needed to drive revenue.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might be thinking: ""Is this a 'sell the news' type event?""  
Answer: Yes and no.  
There are those that front-ran this stock's price action leading up to this event because they know how powerful of a catalyst this event can be. They will undoubtedly sell to secure profits AND to hedge themselves against the possibility that the demo fails (for whatever reason... HIGHLY DOUBTFUL btw).

But here's the kicker: if this event demo proves this company's technology - this will change the game of radiographic imaging as we know it.   
**In other words:** *Every* clinic and hospital in the *entire* world will want to get their hands on this revolutionary technology. And I'm not just talking about purely MD clinics. As a physical therapist myself, I'm talking about potentially utilizing this kind of imaging in our own outpatient clinics! (NO NEED for us to refer out to more expensive radiographic imaging clinics)  
The possibilities are endless.

Let me introduce you guys to Dropbox (ticker DBX).

Dropbox is a Cloud computing company with a market cap of 8.2 billion, meaning it's a small cap growth company. We all use cloud, the need for cloud is consistently rising day over day. The need for Cloud is not going away, so what makes Dropbox a buy over the other cloud computing companies?

1. It has a fantastic PE for a growth company. Yes, PE is not the end all be all, but with a forward PE of 19.42 as a growth stock in a hot sector, that is disgustingly undervalued. 
2. It's branding. Their branding and whole repertoire is centralized around small/midsize businesses. It shows the simplicity of using a cloud product. It's becoming a smart workspace in workspaces and schools alike. It is pretty much the only cloud computing company advertising to such. But don't let that make you think they aren't looking big picture, especially their CEO.
3. Their E signing of documents. If you retards think for a second that within the next 5-10 years all signings of documents wont be electronically, then your out of your mind. DBX is one of the few companies in the cloud computing sector doing this too.
4. Their shift in focus. They have started also focusing on the idea of a at home workspace, which I personally love. Although offices and workspaces alike will always love to unnecessarily bring people in just for the purpose of micromanagement, but this pandemic only showed that working from home is the future. I know many of my IC associates have said they will be doing their walkthroughs and meetings through zoom for the benefits. 
5. Their CEO. Drew Houston has been making some moves. He left a busy California city to move to Houston. This move is good for the future of the company, trying to focus on the vision instead of doing business-esch things. 
6. Not a speculative stock. It has beat on earnings for almost every single earnings report and it's revenue has been going up consistently for years. Analyst price targets are also very bullish, with the median prediction being +45% for the next 12 months. They are sitting on over 1.2 Billion dollars of cash, 50 grand is really nothing to a motherfucker like Dropbox. The only speculative thing I can find is that stock twits is outrageously bullish.

Discussion,"Listen retards, CRM should be your major easy-money move next week (fool-proof instructions inside)",503,k6z2fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6z2fs/listen_retards_crm_should_be_your_major_easymoney/,220,1607163419.0,"**Basics**

Salesforce is a San Fransisco company that offers **C**ustomer **R**elation **M**anagement software (and hence the symbol CRM). It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

**What Happened**

This is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:

https://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2

The sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.

But Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.

So, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.

**What Happened Next**

After the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.

Jim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said ""Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.

Multiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.

Since then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.

Traders have a ""3-Day Rule"" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.

**What's Coming**

[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.

Also, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.

**What Positions**

Do NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):

\- 230C 12/18/2020

\- 250C End of year-February

\- 270C March-May 2021

\- 300C June-July 2021

\- The stock (CRM) if you want to hold for 6 months or more.

**When to Buy**

Do not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.

I think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way. Wait for the dips to buy in.

For those of you who missed the CRM Calls purchase point Wednesday morning and know what the fuck you are doing, I think writing the shit out CRM Puts is still a money move. But I suppose some people might want a cheaper call premium play, with less news and shit, and most you fucking idiots need all the help you can get. 

BBY is another strong options play, I’ll be looking to purchase early next week based on futures and overall market sentiment. But another drop today closed the deal for me. Sticking with ATM calls due to low cost, and we could definitely fall into the 95 range briefly. 

Weekly puts are incredibly cheap, consider mildly protecting your call position over the next two weeks if investing significant equity (sell them fast though!). But this decline is undoubtedly near an end and this bitch is turning around shortly for a couple of reasons. 
Don’t get too technical about the purchase point, current market value is solid as it is. 

First off I don’t like this company in terms of a long term prospect, given the Covid sales bump combined with the vaccine news, but cases are worse then they’ve ever been. Essentially a 9/11 every couple of days.. So that’s good for this one I guess... but as I will probably explain every time, when I give these alerts I’m telling you the price will move upwards enough within the expiration date to exceed theta, but I don’t provide sell points. 

First thing first, the boys at Best Buy are doing a good old fashioned buyback this quarter, so that helps make things guaranteed. We are down well below short moving averages and at our five year moving averages for those of you that give a shit. 

The company has been performing exceptionally during quarantine and has a strong bottom line (Yes I know it went down a bit due to logistical costs of online sales). We will definitely see some positive growth over the next month or two, and it’s another clear example of a stock that is being majorly oversold post earnings. 

If you start typing under the impression I think BBY is going to fly to 125 in two weeks you’re a fucking idiot. Don’t bag hold dumb fucks, especially if you buy OTM calls. 

Don’t think writing puts is an awful strategy on this one either, but think CRM is still better, and you can soak up way more premium with its current IV and volume.",2020-12-05 05:01:59

I have long been tracking this company but I only recently got in with some skin in the game (disclosure – I own \~3000 shares; I am also new to WSB:)). I also think Q3 is an important moment for the company given the institutional dynamics, but **I do NOT think holding through 12/8 would be a good gamble** (which is why you are seeing several people sell their shares to buy in later). Instead, I think there is a better way to play earnings on 12/8.

First off, as everyone knows, Q3 results are going to be ugly. Some have made the argument that the market has already priced this in, but this is only partially true. **Market pricing is dictated by both event-driven probability and hype.** I would guess that the probability of GME missing consensus estimates is \~50/50 (note missing consensus estimates is different from negative growth which is guaranteed in this case). Nobody knows where things will shake out, so the market will price it as such. However, there is a tremendous amount of hype around this stock (for good reason in my humble opinion), which is why I think this stock is trading well heading into an earnings announcement for a turbulent quarter.

Now, **one way to estimate performance is by using credit card activity as a proxy for performance**. We can then use this and compare it to consensus estimates by research analysts:

*Same-Store Sales*

* Telsey: -27.0% (as of 12/2/20)
* Wedbush: -20.0% (as of 12/4/20)

**If you look at credit card data scrapping services, it looks like the quarter will end down around 25 – 30%** (based on the service you use). Obviously this is close to the Telsey number, but its worth noting that these credit card services slightly overestimated performance in Q2 (so the number will likely be closer to -30%). **Therefore, I have a feeling that this stock is going to sell-off significantly**, **making it a much better entry point versus pre-earnings.**

**Personally, I am still long this stock, but it seems like the stock is going to drop in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, which is why I will be holding off from buying on Monday. I’m definitely going to scoop up some more after earnings however!**

A SPAC, In short, is a company that forms for the sole purpose of bringing another company public. The company backing this SPAC is no other than the same which backed Draftkings (Flying Eagle). Flying Eagle’s CEO is Harry Sloan. He has been in the business a long time. He was a founding investor and board member of a company you might have heard of - Bethesda Games. So either he has a great eye for this or he is super lucky - Time will tell. 

Skillz is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that helps developers monetize their games. You likely haven’t heard of most of the games Skillz’s represents, but your grandma probably has. They are: Solitaire Cube, Blackout Bingo, Pool Payday, 21 Blitz and more. All of these are listed on the Apple and Android App Store. All highly rated and with thousands of reviews. The thing that makes them unique vs. other games is that you can 100% legally gamble in them. They accept PayPal and most major credit cards. All withdrawals of winnings can go straight to your bank account. How they managed to get this pass both major App Stores and the US gov I can’t seem to figure out. 

Noteworthy Facts:
1. Forbes named it on its list of the next “Billion dollar start ups”. CNBC named Skillz the “global leader in eSports”. 
2. Skillz players averages 65 min per day. To put in perspective, Netflix only averages 50 min per day, per user. 
3. They expect user growth to get into the “hundreds of millions within the next two years”. 
4. 10 different SPACS tried to bag Skillz IPO, but they decided to pick Flying Eagle because of Harry Slone’s success. 
5. Financials: Third Quarter Revenue of $60 Million (Up 92% Year-over-Year), Revenue for Year to Date of $162 Million, (Up 91% Over Prior Year). Full Year Revenue expected at $225 Million. 
6. Working towards being incorporated into Peleton bikes. 

Skillz checks the box on financials. The rest is up to interpretation. The important take aways for me here is that it’s backed by a guy with a great eye for gaming and a company that has somehow added gambling to these games. I also am seeing little talk about it on stock forms (only 2 posts on WSB in the last 3 months) and the general media for a company that is getting high marks from some major hitters like Forbes and CNBC. It’s been on a steady rise since it officially announced its IPO on Monday, so don’t expect a 100% return, but it’s in no way done. 2 rocket ship emojis

NVAX @ $21 (still holding)
TSLA @ $291 (Post Split)
GME @ $4 (Sold WAY too soon)
SHOP @ $500-ish (made $$ but sold WAY too soon)

I make good money, and have $100k or so that I play with in E*Trade.

I want to start losing everything on Options, but have some questions to make sure I do it as efficiently as possible:

How liquid are ITM options?

If I pick up some TSLA 12/31 $600c, and the stock touches $625, how quickly would I be able to dump the contracts?
is it as quick as with shares?

If I buy $600c contracts, but the price goes down, I’m out only the premium I paid right?
Conversely, if I buy $600p and the price goes up, I’m only out the premium?

It’s only if I “write” contracts that I’m obligated to buy or sell those shares.

Also, I seem to catch on to what you guys are suggesting a little late. I am usually looking at buying into whatever your talking about while it’s near the top (PLTR @ $27.60) What keywords should I be looking for in your retarded posts that will clue me in to what is going to happen before it starts moving? Is it the DD Flair?

Thanks to a catchy ticker, they shot up to \~$32 this week. This of course is retarded. As we all know, our lord and savior Elon Musk hates lidar, and I'm betting this fucker is primed to crater harder than Nikola.

Now when GMHI announced the deal, they were valuing Luminar at roughly $3.5 billion dollars, a bat shit crazy number for a company expecting to do $15 million in revenue this year, and $26 million the next. The market quite understandably knew this was a shit deal, and the stock sat pretty much at NAV forever. Yet today, that company pulling in a cool $15 million is ""worth"" over $10 billion.

Next take a look at Velodyne Lidar, a larger, significantly more established competitor who also briefly topped out at $32 a share, and is now hanging out at just over $15. They were only valued at $1.6 billion in their SPAC deal, and are expecting just over $100 million in revenue this year.

If you need another reason to buy puts, the paint chip eating wizard of Wallstreet Jim Cramer thinks its a bargain at this price.

The memes and kiddy investors think Intel is going down so the IV is low and premiums are at a good price. The bears are always wrong about tech stocks. They think intel is some kind of shitty company that doesn't have the worlds leading market movers invested in their success, I dont know maybe I'm wrong about their thoughts. I can't read their minds but I can read Intels press releases and figures.

News like this about AI, maybe it's not gaming performance but that's not what we are here to talk about:

Edit because trolls:

Look at the greeks of the contract if you know how to read them. They are good for this strike price. 

It is a safe and profitable bet with the delta and vega ratings. A 10% increase in the underlying would put it past strike price and net several hundred % return on investment.

DD,Next Major Position,60,k6sh0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6sh0b/next_major_position/,40,1607141341.0," 

Well well well, its that time of year for me to write a DD post for the 50 odd people that will see it and the 2 people that will actually read this fuckin thing but here goes. Boomer stocks; especially AT&t and GE, are generally looked down on by this forum and for good reason. I took a look at Stocktwits and when AT&T moved up 1 FUCKING percent, people were freaking out, acting as if the messiah had returned or some bullshit. Well, I have reason to believe it's going to move a lot more than just 1 percent over the next month.

First: Potential Price Upgrade?

Currently, Morningstar has a price target of $37 per share, a very nice increase from the current stock price. This is primarily because of Time Warner's willingness to move forwards and keep releasing movies (Some pretty big names such as Godzilla, Mortal Combat, and the Conjuring), even with the Vurus shutting down theaters across the country. Also, AT&T is bidding out DirectTV (even at a potential loss), freeing up its assets for better opportunities.

Second: Technicals:

I will link another post with some technical voodoo in it, but they look good according to my crayon vision. Again, within the next year this could easily hit $37 per share, considering this still has not fully recovered from the crash of March.

This is the major reason as to why I am very interested in this stock. Also, because of the incredibly low IV, options are cheap as hell currently, even ITM monthlys.

Finally, if you want to look at my track record, my two major plays this year was a certain vaccine company (Ticker is banned) back in March, managed to make quite a nice amount off of them when the stock went from my buy in at a little over a dollar to my sale of $6 per share, and my latest play was 369 APHA $17.5 Jan 15 calls which printed like mofos. (You can see my shitty dd on these in past posts).

Anyways, I am not a financial consultant and if you buy anything, do it on your own accord please!

Ranked #4 for average benchmark on UserBenchmarks: [https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/)

AMD seems like they have significantly improved their product line-up compared to the Radeon 5000 Series. AMD's value proposition for as a unified CPU and GPU manufacturer seems to have worked with last gen and current gen game consoles, as both Sony and Microsoft have opted for the same silicon. PC Users may also be attracted by the unified components value proposition and translate to higher PC CPU and GPU sales as AMD has filled the gap with both INTC and NVDA.

Depending on how many GPUs AMD keeps in stock and the actual demand for new GPUs in 2021, I think the 6000 Series could chip away at NVDA's strong lead in market share for GPUs like with Intel CPUs. In doing so, this may attract investors away from NVDA, like with INTC, and boost AMD's stock significantly.

IF (big if) AMD's next CPU/GPU line-up is to overtake NVDA next year, they could easily become the next $500B semi-conductor company in a few years.

I’ve been a lurker of this subreddit for a few years now and always enjoyed the content, the shitposts, the memes, and the rare DD’s. But this week, I’ve feeling for my fellow retards, especially those that gambled their 401k’s and Holographic Charizard Pokemon cards on $PLTR. Orders on $ROPE seem to be up BIGLY 🚀 over the past week, so I wanted to offer a bit of DD on an industry that you and your Netflix and Chill partner have become well acquainted with this year being stuck at home. At the very least, you owe it to your hand to hear me out about Cinemark ($CNK).

TLDR: $CNK 15 Jan 22, 20 Strike Bought Calls / $CNK 19 Mar 21, 12.5 Strike Sold Puts

So quickly, just to get this out of the way: I am a curator of shit. I originally started this reddit account several years ago because I got tired of playing shitty Super Mario Maker levels and had finally decided to make my own. Then, a year later, I was on a Pokemon kick and was desperately looking to trade Pokemon on my 3ds. It’s where I learned to sift through shitty trades and allowed my autism to truly flourish. You ever need a 5 IV hacked Japanese Ditto to get a perfectly spec’d egg? Do you have any idea what the hell I’m talking about? No, probably not. But I bring this up because when you’re willing look into the details so much for a fucking Pokemon, it only makes sense to use that same treatment for a financial investment. And just like Super Mario Maker, I got tired of seeing shitty trades and wanted to do something myself. So I went and studied markets and options the past four years and will likely try and make a career out of finance now.

But you’re here to learn about Cinemark. And here’s what you already know: Movie theaters have been absolutely crippled by Covid. That’s no secret. And just when vaccine news helps to get the likes of CNK and AMC back on their feet a bit, Warner Bros comes out yesterday and says they are moving all of their films to HBO Max. This announcement alone sent movie stocks tumbling as much as 20%.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html)

To add insult to injury, AMC had already announced ANOTHER 200 million shares in a public stock offering THAT MORNING to raise money, with their CEO going on to threaten investors that AMC will go bankrupt without help. This probably isn’t the first time you’ve heard of a possible AMC bankruptcy either, especially if you’re a subscriber to this very subreddit.

[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/)

And here is where I’m gonna start throwing some numbers at you. Because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that AMC is in SERIOUS financial trouble. Pulled from TD Ameritrade, here’s a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in Q3 2020):

Assets:

Cash/Cash Equivalents: $506 million

Total Current Assets: $609 Million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $6,808 million

Total Assets: $10,876 million

Liabilities:

Current Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $1,057 million

Total Current Liabilities: $1,588 million

Total Debt: $5,919 million

Total Liabilities: $13,246 million

So I know what you’re thinking: TLDR, StOp NuMbErs GiVe PoSiTiOnS ReTaRd. And I’ll get there, just like George R.R. Martin is getting to the end of the Game of Thrones series. But what is really important to see here is that for the CURRENT period that ends in one year, AMC has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). And normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. AMC is doing the former with a stock offering. But why not go to a creditor and get a loan? Well, maybe it’s because YTD for Q1, Q2, and Q3, AMC has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. Creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and AMC are in legitimate trouble.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html)

So this brings me to Cinemark and their balance sheet. And it’s here I’ll give you a few more numbers from their Q3 2020 Balance Sheet:

Assets:

Cash/Equivalents: $826 million

Total Current Assets: $984 million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $2,832 million

Total Assets: $5,803 million

Liabilities:

Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $599 million

Total Current Liabilities: $624 million

Total Debt: $2,519 million

Total Liabilities: $4,796 million

So I’d like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for CNK. Due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. What’s more, they can cover ALL of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. This is to say that if you believe that the Covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, Cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales.

The next thing I’d like to bring to your attention is the SIZE of both companies. If you look at the Prop./Plant/Equipment for AMC and CNK, you’ll see that

AMC has $6,808 million in assets

CNK has $2,832 million in assets

AMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. They are over twice the size of Cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of Cinemark’s as well. So AMC does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. However, with AMC’s financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes:

1. AMC goes bankrupt. They will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. Competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and AMC loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for CNK.
2. AMC looks to merge. This is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. And while Cinemark doesn’t have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the AMC currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. If AMC is twice the size of Cinemark, Cinemark’s market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of AMC (and that’s assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). Cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but CNK has also shown that they can manage their book better. They may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on.
3. AMC gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. Cinemark isn’t really affected by this outcome.

Next, let’s consider the technicals of Cinemark. Cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in March. It was trading as low as $5.71 at it’s lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of September to November 9th(vaccine news day), CNK was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. With positive vaccine news and a rollout of vaccinations, it is likely that CNK will be able to open its doors again in the next six months. As such, there is a case to be made for CNK not breaking a fairly strong level of support moving forward.

The last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. But since the election and Pfizer/Moderna’s vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. Specifically, money in the NASDAQ (Covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to Covid. Retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with Covid relief. You don’t have to look much farther than stocks like Kohl’s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like Tesla and AMD, of course). Many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where I personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. Sure, Covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the NASDAQ taking up arms again. But the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when Covid has been dealt with.

So to bring this all full circle, here is my TLDR for why Cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into:

1. It has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy.
2. With AMC on the ropes, CNK could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if AMC does file bankruptcy. They could even pick up existing AMC theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate AMC structure were to occur.
3. While still trading below its pre-Covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). And while Covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because CNK has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up.

Positions? TLDR? Give yourself a year on this one. Buy a leap and leave it for a while. If you hate getting cucked by Theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike OTM puts. That way, if you end up getting put shares, it’s of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). Premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in Theta and Vega.

CNK 15 Jan 2022 20 Bought Call: 4.00 (as of this writing)

CNK 19 March 2021 12.5 Sold Put: 2.40 (as of this writing). With a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. If Cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% ROI (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like I do).

The last 2 SPAC mergers, QS on Nov.27, and LAZR since... Yesterday,  have popped in over ~150% gains in the week of the merger (including substantial dips). 

Arko Holdings LTD. is an Israeli-based company which owns over 3000 retail stores in USA over 20+ states, and looking for further business expansion next year.

My DD is based off their positive financials and revenue growth over COVID which leaves more hope for the future of brick&mortar stores, and they operate in convenience / groceries, which reminds me of $USFD (US Foods, spiking ~80% in the last 2 months), and a little of foreign companies like OZON (Russian e-commerce retailer similar to shop or amazon), gaining 20% in the last two weeks since IPO, due to foreigner companies doing US business/stock exchange.

Most importantly, last 2 SPAC mergers in QS and LAZR, are looking fire hot right now in their valuation increases, while both are in the EV bubble, Arko is already well established, and for a company about to merge at NAV, they are grossly undervalued. Arko Holdings trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at ~76 USD, while remaining at ~10 USD NAV on NASDAQ.

HYAC + Arko SPAC will likely pop in the coming days, get it in while you can.

TLDR: New SPAC merger between HYAC and ARKO HOLDINGS sitting at NAV($10), very high upsides due to people on the EV train/bubble and not looking at other companies with established financials and growth - recent mergers in QS and LAZR indicate potential pops with low downsides. Get in while you can 🚀🚀🚀

Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let’s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.

The [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)

The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.

Here is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. 

The [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.

While yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.

Also, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million

Meanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.

Moving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.

This is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA

[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don’t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.

While I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don’t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.

A couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. 

While Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. 

Bad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner’s decision to send all they’re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn’t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.

And one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave & Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.

Older scanners needed to do one ‘slice’ every 2 or 3 millimetres. Very slow. Large radiation dose. Largely phased out. Newer machines are ‘helical‘ scanners. Take pictures in a spiral, not slices. Much faster, much less radiation.

Current CAT scanners have software to enable 3D reconstruction of solid objects: like bones. The reconstructed image can then be rotated so you can ‘see’ what it looks like in 3D. As you can imagine, this ability is crucial in several medical / surgical specialties.

It is not clear if NNOX scans can do this. The presentation yesterday was not clear on this point. The scans are described as ‘tomograms’ which means slices, but not clear if 3D reconstruction possible AND THIS MATTERS.

The total radiation dose for a NNOX scan also matters, although unlikely an issue.

Have written to them. Bombard them with the question: does NNOX scan allow 3D reconstruction?

Edit: broke the golden rule: 127.78 shares at 57.8. There is another potential problem: NNOX business case is ‘pay per play’ I.e. pay per X-ray or scan, rather than outright sale of equipment. This is open to accusations of profiteering IF the costs are seen to be exploitative. They also make a HUGE claim that X-rays or scans will be interpreted by AI assisted by remote radiologists. Established radiologists are not going to like this one bit.

* ZUO is a SaaS company like PLTR and enables subscription commerce for companies who want to transition their businesses from traditional one time transactions to Netflix-like recurring subscriptions.
* Recurring subscription are valued much higher by boomer shareholders (# PLTR), making ZUO an attractive play for every major company on the planet
* ZUO already transact $12B+ of annual subscriptions with massive growth rates
* Unlike PLTR, ZUO has been trading sideways since IPO two years ago and is currently near all time lows. Absolute bargain and can only go up from here! Very cheaply valued compared to nearly all other SaaS companies.

* **Just released an earnings and forecast beat, sending shares up 5.7% premarket. Closed biggest deal in history this quarter. Will keep beating earnings from here according to industry trend.**
* ZUO benefits from the global digitisation trend, which has been accelerated by the pandemic and is expected to further take-off in 2021. Most enterprise companies (massive total addressable market) are very early in their journey, but will eventually transition to recurring subscriptions which ZUO is uniquely positioned to support

Airbnb intends to IPO at a price of $44-50 per share. At the $50 mark, that's a equity valuation of $35 billion. 

**Who TF is the Dean and why should we listen to what he says?**

His name is Aswath Damodaran who is finance professor at NYU and teaches corporate valuation among other things. Sometimes interviewed on CNBC to balance out the crazies. He always says he doesn't aim to time the market, but he did buy TSLA pretty much at the very bottom at $180 some time ago (I always regret not following his trade), although he did sell a bit later around the $600 mark (pre-split).

**Ok, tell me what he valued Airbnb at:**

About $36 billion or $54.41 per share (he takes into account options, warrants, RSUs etc)

**TL:DR**

Buying Airbnb at $54 is a fair price from a valuation perspective. The further below, the better the buy.

See his original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k380yz/squeeze_on_steel/.  

While US Steel will get its gains, I think an even better opportunity lies with Cleveland Cliffs (CLF).  Cleveland Cliffs is a company that previously specialized in making iron ore pellets.  In the past decade, they have had a market cap in excess of $14B, vs a market cap now of just under $5B.  However, they have recently been on a buying spree.  Cleveland Cliffs acquired AK Steel Holding Corporation in Mar-2020, a company operating 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants.  AK Steel is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products.  They are also in the process of acquiring ArcelorMittal USA later in Q4 2020.  What does that give us?  A vertically integrated supply chain, baby!
 
As you can see in their 10Q, they’ve nearly tripled their revenue on a quarterly basis over the last year.  The one down side is their net income was fairly low due to high COGS.  This is where the vertically integrated supply chain comes in.  They will be able to take it from the mines to pellets to flat rolled steel and keep all those sweet profits to themselves.  The net margin has trended fairly well over time, with the exception of an odd year or two here and there (2014-2016... ouch!, and 2020).  It has always bounced back though to the 15-20% range.  Add to that the backdrop of steel prices rising ~17% in the last two months, and you have some very profitable quarters incoming.  Additionally, their current ratio is very good, so despite making acquisitions, they have maintained a rock-solid balance sheet, pun intended.  I think this could run up to low 30’s.  Look at what the steel industry does: overreacts to supply and demand.  I can smell the tendies already.

DD,The Future Of Plastics,18,k6f062,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6f062/the_future_of_plastics/,27,1607089851.0,"Good Morning Degenerates,

&#x200B;

Welcome to today's History & Science Class. Today, we will be learning about plastics.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are renewably-derived polymers that are entirely biodegradable and compostable. As you may know, other polymers require industrial recycling to be broken down. Authentic tards may be familiar with the PHA firm Metabolix, now called Yield10 Bioscience, which sank millions of tendies a few years ago developing the same science. The market was not ready then - but now - This Is The Way.

If you haven't heard from the likes of Robert Downey Jr yet, then here's the present. We generate over 300 million metric tons of plastic - equal to the weight of the entire human population. You think electric cars and solar power are the only way to solve our problems and go green? Think again.

The PHA market is approximately 1% of the entire plastic market. The largest barrier for this emerging market is the cost of raw materials, and refinding said materials. With that, the inability to achieve economies of scales is the largest, and one of the only major restrictions on the market.

Now turn to Danimer Scientific. This company has been a leader in PHAs for years on years as a privately-run company. Now I'm only half-stupid so I'm not sure if any posts have been made about this, but the SPAC Live Oak Aquisition Corp ($LOAK) has a definitive merger agreement with Danimer Scientific, providing $200 million in equity of the $890 closing equity valuation. Danimer Scientific is anticipated to go public as early as the end of this year, or early 2021.

What's this? Too good to be true? You heard me right, bitch. You better steal every last dime from your wife's boyfriend's wallet, because this is the future. One's first thought might be, "" Well, if this failed before, who's to say it yields now?""

Hear ye, motherfucker. Think:

\-Green New Deal

\-Net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality

\-Global Paris Agreement

&#x200B;

Danimer already has deals with the likes of Coca-Cola, Columbia, and Nestle. With the current deals they have, they are already at capacity. The funding secured from the merger, private investors, etc. will provide the necessary funding to develop another factory. With the funding already secured, they are prepared to increase production capacity 10x by 2025, thus increasing scale and profitability. The company has only around 20 million in debt, and has the growth potential of fucking Apple or Tesla. I will pour my life savings into this just to prove that I am right. I'll see you on the other side bitches.

If you do any DD on PHAs you'll find Danimer right in the Top 5 of the global list. If you want to waste your tendies on PLTR and NIO calls I don't give a shit, but this is the future.",2020-12-04 08:50:51

WELL GUESS WHAT. CRSP just participated in an investor conference. Since they did that, the price has been climbing. I just saw an article for a medical journal - RELEASED TODAY! talking about the breakthrough they’ve had treating a patient with sickle cell disease and another who required regular blood transfusions. Both effectively cured. This news just came out to the public today. I checked the options and CRSP 1/15 $160 has the volume and OI (1584) needed for a play. Sizzle index (if you pay any attention to that) is 2.02 calls to 0.68 puts. I don’t ever remember seeing it that high before. Now that this news is out to the public, I predict the price will continue on its current trajectory.

Given that, I made this shitty model that uses the quarter-to-date e-commerce order data, credit card data scrapes from two separate vendors (& sticking my fucking finger in the air), as well as that bullshit finance stuff that nerds use to come up with a 4Q estimate since the sell-side analysts are such shit-head haters and probably work for Melvin Capital (fuck 'em).

IDGAF if this is gibberish to you, but it tells me and the other autists that the analysts are fucking wrong and 4Q20 is going to crush Wall Street's estimates. Yes 4Q20, which comes in March, not 3Q20 which comes on Tuesday.

DD,$TU 🚀 An opportunity to print free tendies,111,k7ig1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7ig1o/tu_an_opportunity_to_print_free_tendies/,80,1607240495.0,"Based on the title of this post, you must be asking to yourself that ""What the hell is TU?"" never heard about it.Oh boy, you're missing out on lovely tendies if you haven't heard about the **🚀 TU.**

&#x200B;

***Description***

Telus Communications is a company that provides services such as internet access, voice, entertainment, healthcare, video etc. It's basically a huge ass Canadian company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia with a market cap of **25B$.**

&#x200B;

***Why is this a solid play?***

The stock is currently trading at **$19.91** with low IV. The stock needs to go up by only **9 cents** in next 2 weeks for you to print tendies. **$20.00** Strike is going for only **0.18** cents each. If the stock goes to **20.3$** by December 18 then you print around **66%.** Not bad, huh? I have posted a chart from option profit calculator incase you wanna see how much tendies you'll print on the potential target price.

The IV is also extremely low so the probability of you getting IV crushed are 0 to none as long as it keeps going up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Recent Trend***

TU has been growing slow and steadily for the past month and could potentially cross 20.2$ by EOW. It grew by around **2.7%** in the last month. Don't believe me? Look at the 1 month trend below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Financials***

If you look at their income statement, they have a good revenue stream and were not much affected by Covid. Infact, they added more customers in quarter 3. Their numbers show that they're also financially healthy and have a good profitability margin. This isn't a company to go down overnight or a company that swings a lot.

&#x200B;

***Analyst comments***

This is what equity analyst **""Matthew Dolgin, CFA""** of MorningStar says about the company :""Telus handily beat FactSet consensus revenue estimates while falling short on the profit lines in what was nonetheless an outstanding third quarter. Results exceeded our expectations throughout wireless and wireline as the firm once again led the industry across most key metrics. Despite the pandemic, customer additions equaled or exceeded last year’s third-quarter result in every category. Our long-term outlook and CAD 29 fair value estimate are unchanged, and we think this best-of-breed company is undervalued.""Here's the link to the Equity Report if you wanna read the entire thing  - [MorningStar Link](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/tu/analysis)

&#x200B;

***Now you must be thinking, oh he def trynna pump this shit. Why did stonk not go up if the Q3 earnings were good?***

Well one of the reasons could be their **EBITDA. $TU's** ebitda was quite a lot down from the same period last year (Q3,2019) and it didn't improve from their previous quarterly results. On the other hand, their competitors had better adjusted **EBITDA** and had improved from previous quarters.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)\*\*\*As you all know Canadians are known for their kindness and public likes this company for what they have done during pandemic. Telus contributed around $150 million for the covid relief and expanded their programs to help citizens. They also started two business units only focused towards the positive economic and social outcomes for the Canadians.

***Institutional Buyers***

Many institutional buyers have increased their holdings after Q3 in TU. There are around 497 institutional owners holding approx 58% of the shares of this company.

***Risks***

TU uses Huawei equipments for their 3G and 4G networks and if the Canadian government considers to put a regulatory restriction and banning Huawei equipments then the stock price could plummet but there have been no recent news about it and its highly unexpected from Canadian government. With the Canadian wireless network being a lot less penetrated than United States & Europe, this stock is most likely to go up in the near future.

At this point, the proof  of concept phase is over and people are starting to see dollar signs.  CRSP company has already ran from \~$80 to $148 in the last month, and it  will likely run pretty far on Monday. No telling how long they will  keep this valuation before people want to see products and profits, but  it should stay fairly high for some time. This is a huge leap forward in  medicine.

That said, I also think  the additional validation this trial provides for CRISPR/cas9 genome  editing in humans will boost all related stocks, and at the very least  bias investors to have bullish outlooks for similar companies. This  means the market psychology is going to change such that investors will likely  be prone to pumping other genome editing companies on seemingly little  to no news.

If you want to  research related companies in the field, look at EDIT, NTLA, VRTX, and  BEAM. I know nothing about these companies yet, other then they  specialize in genome editing. I'll be looking into them more this  weekend. Please feel free to post what you know below.

Now, if you're an unwoke retard, which you probably are, the first thing you think of is ""They're still alive?"" / ""they still sell phones?"" / ""hurr durr what is this 2010?"" Don't worry, you're not alone, as this assumption doesn't elude even the best boomer trader of them all, Jim Cramer, who just 2 days ago told people to ""sell Blackberry and buy Apple"" after the Amzon announcement (to be covered in a bit). Newsflash -- they don't even compete in the same market anymore, boomer!! They haven't been competing in the same market since 2013, as they quietly pivot from hardware to software. 

In short, Blackberry is now a software company, who has a powerful operating system, QNX, which is used in Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Toyota cars. BlackBerry just partnered with Amazon to develop BlackBerry IVY, which collects a multitude of vehicle data from all these manufacturers. Yes, it is true that Tesla has a HUGE advantage over any other single (keyword: single) automobile manufacturer when it comes to driving and road data, but what happens when you consolidate EVERYONE ELSE who is frothing to beat Tesla for vehicle and road data? BB's data (scaling with AWS) will absolutely catch up and crush TSLA's.

Hold on it gets better. BB ALSO does cybersecurity with US FedRAMP certifications, which allows the US government to use their end to end solution for secure communications. They also own AtHoc, which has been crushing it for COVID crisis communications for universities, hospitals, and Fortune 500 companies, including a partnership with ServiceNow for incident management tracking, and in Microsoft Teams for enterprise communications. For a cybersecurity comparison, Crowdstrike (CRWD) trades at a price-to-sales ratio of roughly 40x, Palo Alto Networks at about \~8x. BB ""only"" make 800-1b annually and growing, (about what Palantir makes), and is **only** trading at 3.3x sales. If someone can give me DD on why CRWD will eat BB's lunch, I will eat my socks if BB doesn't eventually float up closer to these valuations.

 If this company were rebranded RaspBerry and fresh IPOing today you bet your ass it would instantly be a 30 to 50bill market cap company. Factor in ""car data"", ""government security contracts"" hype add another 10billion. I almost don't want to post this DD as I'm not done accumulating shares yet, but will definitely be buying on any pullback.

TLDR: BlackBerry 1/15 9c, eyeing the 3/19 10c. AMD flashbacks to when they were only worth 4billion.

DD,Political analysis for why EVs are not done exploding,47,k7go1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7go1t/political_analysis_for_why_evs_are_not_done/,43,1607234246.0,"I work in the EV advocacy and clean air arena. Let me tell you why EVs are not done yet and are only going to 🚀🚀 in 2021 and the following years.  I am approaching this analysis from a political and policy standpoint - so my analysis of individual EV companies will be limited but is meant to provide a bullish outlook for why regulations will be placed on fuel economy standards and what that means for the future of the auto industry.   


**BACKGROUND**  
The transportation sector is responsible for majority of climate change driven emissions in the United States. Within the transportation sector, majority of the emissions comes from light-duty vehicles (LDV) which dominate the overall fleet numbers. However, although the medium and heavy duty vehicle (MHDV) fleets comprise a tiny percentage of the overall US fleet, they disproportionately contribute over 50% of NOx emissions.   


Because of this, there is increased pressure to accelerate EV adoption both in the LDV and MHDV sectors. How will this be done?

* Incentives (rebates, tax credits, installation)
* Regulations (fuel economy, ZEV mandates)

Unfortunately, none of the incentives or regulations have gained much traction under Trump, who has been anti-climate and pro oil and gas, Under Trump, the EPA attacked California and revoked their state authority to set higher greenhouse gas emissions standards than federal ones. Under the Clean Air Act, Section 177, states are given the authority to do this but the EPA must grant them a waiver to do so. There is ongoing litigation on this issue. GM, Toyota, and Fiat-Chrysler [sided](https://apnews.com/article/bb5788e2e8d84a488599c62f8006ca97) with Trump on this issue. GM recently left the lawsuit when Biden won. 

Trump also rolled back the strongest climate policy on the books, which was Obama's Fuel Economy standards. The Obama standards end goal was 54.5 MPG Fuel efficiency and would have limited climate-disrupting pollution by 6 billion tons, save consumers $1.7 trillion dollars in fuel costs, and reduce oil consumption by up to 4 million barrels a day.  As part of the rollback - Trump instituted his own fuel economy rules called the SAFE rule - which has been deemed inadequate by both environmental and auto groups. 

**WHAT IS BIDEN GOING TO DO?** 

Joe Biden has the most ambitious climate agenda in modern history. His proposal costs 90x more than what Obama had proposed. With the US falling behind in emissions reduction - the administration knows they need to act fast, aggressive, and be bold. 

Upon entering office on Jan 20, Joe Biden in his first 100 days will make sweeping executive changes and orders that will affect the auto industry and boost EV adoption. 

* He will rollback the Trump rollbacks of California's authority and the Obama Clean Car standards.
* The EPA will grant California their authority back to enforce their LDV standards (14 other states have already adopted the California LDV standards). 
* The EPA will also grant California their authority to enforce their new [Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT)](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/advanced-clean-trucks-fact-sheet) rule, which they just proposed and adopted this past summer, which will require manufacturers to increase their electric MHDV sales to be 30-50 percent by 2030. Other states are going to adopt this California truck standard. 
* **He will institute a National EV Mandate.** The details of this are unclear so far as to how he will do this - but it will be subtle. There won't be a regulation or requirement for 100% EV sales or total fleet turnover by a certain year (I could be wrong but it would be harder to push through). What I think they will do is they will build upon the Obama Fuel Economy standards of 54.5 MPG, and propose and adopt a rule for an MPG standard that is strong enough that **ONLY EVS will meet those requirements** and the cost to produce gas vehicles at such high standards will incentivize EV adoption and deter automakers from producing gas vehicles. Effectively an EV mandate, but not in name. 
* He will invest 500,000 charging stations across the country

**WHAT ARE POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS?** 

* Some Automakers: The EV market is still very nascent and EVs represent a very very small portion of overall vehicle sales. Some automakers are still incentivized to sell gas vehicles since that's what the majority of consumers want. Other automakers recognize that if they don't switch to EVs soon - Daddy Elon Musk is going to own the world 
* Consumers: Lack of charging stations, battery range, low supply of EVs, and general misinformation against EVs are currently deterring consumers from making the switch
* Labor: There are over 1.7 million jobs in the auto industry, majority of which work for the Big 3 American automakers who are slow on transitioning towards EVs. EVs are easier to manufacture and produce and require less workers. They also require less service and repair. The autoworkers union is heavily invested in making sure jobs are not lost in this transition towards EVs
* Dealers: The dealer model is under direct attack from EV manufacturers who directly sell to consumers. Additionally, majority of the revenue for dealers does NOT come from selling vehicles, but it comes from service and maintenance of cars. EVs save consumers  thousands of dollars less annually on service and maintenance

**CONCLUSION**

* EVs are the future. The Biden EV plan will spur EV adoption and transform the industry. Both the  LDV and MHDV sectors will be under pressure due to regulation and climate goals to go electric. GO LONG 🚗🚗 AND TO THE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2020-12-06 00:57:26
Discussion,"Basic Small Money Plays For a This Wild and Crazy Market - IPO's, SPAC's, and New Tech; Oh My!",9,k7eb9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7eb9q/basic_small_money_plays_for_a_this_wild_and_crazy/,20,1607226449.0,"**One big thing stands out to me in the ""recent"" market** that seems like an old concept being pushed hard again\*\*:\*\*

**Some new IPO's/SPAC's, or** just **companies** that have been **under the radar** and already passed over for what appeared to be better long term investments, **are going for modern or interesting sounding names and tickers**, that may intended **to boost interest in younger investors.**

**LISTEN HERE:**

**THIS IS SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, NO SHIT SHERLOCK, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.**

**SO DO IT THIS TIME, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! BUY BEFORE THE MEME GETS SOMEONE RICH THAT'S NOT YOU!**

The **new tickers that move** are ones that **have things that make them sound cool,** and **that's** really **all that matters.** Usually the **name is catchy,** the **ticker is** often **easy to remember and** might even look like it should go that Porsche **you're going to** buy when it's **finally** your turn to **get** rich and post gain **porn.**

**LOOK: These tickers don't require as much fundamental quantification**, compared to some REIT named $LAME buying up closed down dollar general store locations, or something equally boring to talk about. It's all about marketing and perception.

**THE GAMBLE:** What **I suggest** is going **long** on **shares** when you see these particular types of stocks hit the market, especially if you're hearing people asking about them a lot, because if people are interested in crap only because the ticker, product, or company name sounds cool, you may have a winner.

**Typically,** **you want to see if there's a little dip first. If you're already in, this is not the time to sell and try to time re-entry.**  **Some IPO's don't allow shorting for a certain duration,** but that doesn't mean price cannot drop initially. Also, **not all IPO's will run options until a certain number of days have passed,** and there may be some wait before hype is prepared to move the stock, **so watch the option volume very closely and see if it begins to look liquid.** Take this time to consider if the stock will have some sort level of excitement in it, and attract attention. It should sound cool. Honestly, **it should be something that you might not buy yourself, but** you'd definitely **want to try it out or learn more about what the heck this** ticker **thing is** trying to sell if you weren't so lazy and it was free.

We have seen things with **names like LAZR** recently, **pumped by Cramer**, with ooooooo, maybe a military contract, and ahhhh, cool cameras that can probably spot people really far away.

**RKT**, because it even if it has reasonable fundamentals, you know it had to go up for a bit, **because it's named rocket...**

**NIO, PLUG, LI, FCEL, FLIR, PLTR** (I haven't even read the Lord of the Rings series and I know the reference), **TSLA, NKLA, ZooM**, and so forth. **Many** of these companies **doubled, trippled, or** went up even **more,** in very short periods.

Now, **some of those companies** have some value, and some do not, or certainly **not worth** what **their local maxima** will become, so you want to **get in cheap and early as hype begins,** but ***before any major price move***, **and then just wait for the gains and GTFO of the stock unless it's run by some incredibly weird entrapreneur that gets regular interviews on any damn show he wants.** So much of the market is over bought, that people will buy any piece of crap that sounds cool. That's it. That's all you need to know.

**First, I suggest getting the WeBull app**. A lot of people have it, whether that's their broker or not, because it does a few things right, but **mainly it's a convenient way to find out what IPO's may be coming up**. **RKT, PLTR, and many others were announced well in advance via WeBull,** and **if you have notifications on** for it\*\*, you'll get the ""memo""\*\* that some of retail is getting. Now **don't go buying every IPO.** You want to **look for a** **product that sounds like it has future potential**, something **not fully tapped into yet,** and the **company name must grab your attention**. You want **a name that sounds exciting and fast paced** to retail. Something that **if you said it at the dinner table,** or around friends, **would the name make people seem honestly interested?**

I have been sitting through this bull run, selling positions early, not going in on the companies I mentioned, using rational reasoning for why to buy a stock. This is not the time for being completely rational. Your investment accounts should be Boglerific, but **your play money needs to find a home in these types of stocks**, **take the large gain when it comes, and dump** the stock **before everyone else** does.

Buy long duration vertical calls if they're available, but **don't plan to hold longer than whenever the spike comes.** **Vertical spreads help reduce IV cost somewhat** (usually) as the two strikes will partially cancel out each others vega, so this lets you get in with a defined risk amount. Shares are still the safer way, as puts will likely be not liquid enough at first to sell bull put verticals, and IPO's like this are more likely to tripple in the first 6 months than they are to become 1/3rd.

**THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A STRATEGY MOSTLY FOR AN OVERBOUGHT MARKET WITH LITTLE ELSE TO PICK FROM.**

Outside of just the sheer amount of labor involved with trying to legitimize these businesses (does not fit the Q1 2021 timeline to get these guys above the board) there is no possible way that Bill, Baupost, Guggenheim, the Ontario teachers union would be seeded so heavily in the SPAC just for it to come out as PornHub and hounded for supporting a business who profits off of the exploitation of Minors and Rape.

DD,NNOX - radiologist's DD,49,k7ai6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7ai6r/nnox_radiologists_dd/,40,1607214683.0,"I've been lurking here for years for the hilarious memes. It's time for me to actually contribute something.

I've been a radiologist for years. I watched NNOX's RSNA (Disneyland for radiology) presentation. I attended RSNA virtually for professional reasons of course. I'm going to keep this as short and simple as possible. 

Background on NNOX and x-rays

NNOX proposes a room-temp, ?cheaper electron gun to make x-rays, as opposed to the currently used hot electron gun. Keep in mind x-rays have a lot more parts than just the electron gun (target, bucky, brightness control). X-rays are used in radiographs (2D picture), tomosynthesis (fancy x-ray that allows you to determine depth, requires 180degrees view), and CT scans (requires 360degrees view). 

What did NNOX present?

A human hand radiograph and dummy tomosynthesis using their gun. Nothing I saw was technologically shocking. In fact, I read hundreds of radiographs and dozens of tomo images this week. Side note, him comparing his hand x-ray next to Dr. Rotengen's first medical x-ray from >100years ago was a little tachy, like putting your selfie next to a portrait of jesus. 

Sentiment

Very few people have heard of them in the professional imaging community. I can't find any scientific papers about their tech. Kinda sus...

Regulatory

I'm sure they'll get their 510(k) approved. That's a really low bar. 

My thoughts on their proposal

Pay-per-scan x-ray, AI/cloud/network/\*insert tech buzzword here\*-based interpretation. Major healthcare systems just would not go for that. EVen assuming their tech is both cost-effective and non-inferior, their proposal disrupts (not in a good way) too many things simultaneously (radiologists' and technologists' workflow, reimbursement, existing vendors etc.). Don't get too excited about AI in radiology btw. It's underwhelming at best. 

I'm sure they have valid use cases though - such as rural areas, developing countries (if you're investing, think about the TAM here). I believe their team isn't out to scam people, like NKLA or Theranos. I just wish they would open their technology to peer review and quash any doubts. 

My positions

No position in NNOX. I don't feel like backing or shorting them. Unless something changes, I'll just watch from the sidelines. 

If I turn out to be horribly wrong, feel free to rub it in. 

Long TDOC and butterfly.

This has been talked about here for months now so bear with me as I needed a place to rant.

Like many, I’ve been following most of these EV companies since the summer. I mean who isn’t enticed by seeing people make 300% in a month? It’s completely rationale to want and get in on the action. Hell, I consider myself a conservative investor and even I’ve made money on some of these names so I guess you can call me a hypocrite for even writing this.

At some point though one has to recognize just how irrational this has become. No revenue until 2025? No problem, here’s a $17 BILLION market cap (talking about you quant scape). Go onto any EV/SPAC forum or Stocktwits and dare to question a valuation or why a stock tripled in a week. Ask about the potential dilution from warrants or PIPE shares set to go out. You’ll likely just get a cocky response about having FOMO. These bulls are getting so caught up in the moment with short term gains, it reminds of those 2 Florida real estate guys from The Big Short:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfu_iFS-UY8

Take PIC for example. Traded around its NAV (basically a price floor before merger) for months before abruptly surging. Nothing has changed about the company -  no new catalysts other than rumors of a potential merger date which is widely expected. What is the rationale for paying double what the company was valued at a couple weeks ago? These SPACs are becoming commodities in a sense that it’s solely supply/demand driven by hype and literally nothing else. 

I guess to me the worst part of all this and why it bothers me so much is that 99.9% of the time it will be that average Joe who eventually loses cause they put too much of their savings into a SPAC at $50 after watching some pumper from YouTube who used bright colors and 500% gains In the thumbnail. 

You know who wins 99.9% of the time? Institutions and hedge funds. They are eating this up. Whether it is just shorting these risky stocks or taking advantage of the arb opportunities. I’ve counted 6 recently merged SPACs that have significant spreads between the common stock and warrants. Arbitrageurs are locking in these gains - eventually taking retail money. 

I know I sound lame but this EV hype is getting dangerous and people need to be aware of how this will end. Some will make money short term and know when to get out but a lot of ignorant people are going to lose money once the dust settles with all this.

DD,MUFG DD,36,k7712b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7712b/mufg_dd/,64,1607201879.0,"TL;DR: MUFG's price is way under the actual value of the stock. The MUFG $5 2/19/21 Call option at .10 is beyond undervalued.

Yesterday, I posted my [gains chart for the past month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6u2m2/thank_you_all_for_changing_my_life/) where I've consistently been moving up to what amounted to a +780.93% return on investments. I did this through personal research into stocks, statistics, value ratios, and game theory. I've listened to what successful people were doing on this sub and modified it for my own personal strategy.

People have been asking what my positions were so I've decided to start doing write ups. I'm currently invested in 12 companies, most which have already made me profits. My strategy is simple, find companies that are very undervalued and compare the risk to reward ratios for the various call options.

Today, I want to tell you about MUFG. 


**Value Ratios**


Earning per share - .24

Price per Book - .36

Projected Earning Growth - .83

Annual Dividend is at 5.29%

These numbers by themselves tell me that the current price of MUFG is way below what the actual value of the stocks are. These value ratios mean that the stock price is heavily incentivized to go up.

This company has already hit two major floors, one being the major sell-off since it's high at just over $8 down to a floor of around $5, and a floor of $3.43 after the Coronavirus sell-off. I'm not worried about this stock crashing anymore because it has already crashed as hard as it can. It is currently making it's recovery.

In January, Biden will take over as president and I anticipate many policies will be made to get an actual economic recovery underway. I don't believe this has been priced into MUFG's current price yet. 

I understand this is a Japanese company, but we have to understand that the stocks in an American stock market are pushed mainly by American investors. Once more Americans have disposable income, there will be more money thrown into the stock market, and I believe that if the actual value of MUFG doesn't entice investors, it's 5.29% dividend will.

Options for this stock are pretty low volume. I bought 50 shares of MUFG $5 2/19/21 at an average of .12 per share. This is a price I would expect for a weekly expiration, not one in February. In order to profit, the stock needs to hit $5.13 by 2/19.

The floor of this stock before the Pandemic was already at $5 and was making a recovery before Covid struck. I don't see how this stock does not eventually go back up to it's floor of $5, if not surpass that floor and go on to $6 or $7.

Again, at calls prices at .10, I felt that it would be ludicrous to not throw something in and see if I'm right.

After it's first major sell off, MUFG hovered around $5 a share before it started going back up. This was stopped by the Coronavirus outbreak, which caused another sell off to $3.43 in March. Ever since then, this stock has been making a slow, but steady climb up.

The stock has already grown 28% since hitting it's floor in March. It showed recent highs of 4.62 on 11/17 and 11/24. In order for it to hit 5.13, the stock needs to grow just 16.85% more.

Unless something crazy happens, I don't see how this stock doesn't hit at least $5.13 by the time this option expires. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this stock was around $6 or $6.5 by the time all is said and done.

Once people realize the value of this company, people will buy shares. Once people buy shares, people will realize that the options are valuable. Once people realize that, the price of the option should go up.

For $12 and option, I am giving myself the opportunity to make a huge return on investment if my math and logic are right. If it doesn't hit, I've really not lost that much money.

How did I make 780.93% return on the stock market this past month? These are the types of bets I make. I've had more hits than misses, and the hits easily outweigh the misses.

If you liked this write-up and would like more, I'm happy to present write-ups for some of my other positions. I have call options for TROX (Already up 59.22% with an expiration in 2/19), UNM (bought at .20, up to .53, exp. 3/19), KNOP, LFC, SPTN, GTN, PTVE, AMKR, CS, and TKC. Please fill free to nitpick, ask questions, or shoot my theory down. The more we work together, the better chance we have at actually finding bets that make profits.",2020-12-05 15:57:59

The market sentiment was weak this week because of the SaaS sector earnings risks and the desire of hedge funds to get in cheaper for a second December rally. HOHOHO.

Salesforce got hammered to create enough delta for a gap up back to $250+ for accumilation. 

Snowflake couldn't stay down and its valuation is absurd, approxiamtely the size of IBM.

Palantir will retest $30 and breakout, just because SNOW did. ($370s) It's up to 2.5X PLTR market capitalization with half the revenue and an operating loss of 14 million. These SNOW investors paid up early for next year 2022. All the Warren Buffett hype and it's paid for WallStreet IPO client/Brokerage PR bias shilling (even by Cramer who won't support PLTR because of the Direct Listing model as an ex-hedge fund manager)

Facebook's underwriters were Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Barclays and Allen & Co. - and they fucked Facebook with a botched roadshow and  didn't say anything meaningful to shore up its 16 month share price collapse. 

They were too busy being bearish on FB and probably shorted it themselves, especially Goldman Sachs. 

Peter Thiel is a Director on the Facebook Board and remembers what low value paying $350 million for IPO offers.

Thiel and Karp dumped very cheap shares on the first trading day to provide liquidity and Wall Street was (by law very neutral but with a bearish vibe with chicken little risky risky!!!) 

This company would have been IPO listed at $35 a share, still making it much cheaper than the Snowflake IPO. But you can't withhold Wallstreet its tendie tribute. Thiel took it directly to the exchange. 

Meme stock or not, I'm disappointed to see the lack of faith in this company because of a broad market shakeout. $21 was a great entry point, but people expect to realize their ideal oversold wet dream. The Germans are bullish still calling it the next Tesla fairy-tale story. Karp is phil-German and speaks fluently while studying in Frankfurt for years and considers it his cultural homeland. Thiel is German American. So was Wernher Von Braun...*cough Elon Musk the South African/Canadian of Dutch ancestory.

Real estate investor here. If no one buys a home at all in 2021 buying GHIV still works and this is why:

Homeowners rolling over old mortgages into new ones accounted for 62 percent of all lending activity in the second quarter of 2020, up from 54.5 percent of loans in the first quarter of 2020 and from 39.6 percent in the second quarter of 2019.

Even your grandma is getting a refi for 2.5%, and she owned her house outright. Good job grandma.

Metro areas with at least 1 million people that saw refinance activity at least doubled, year over year, in the second quarter of 2020 included Washington, DC (up 219.9 percent); Milwaukee, WI (up 213.1 percent); Austin, TX (up 211.9 percent); Raleigh, NC (up 205.3 percent) and Birmingham, AL (up 198.4 percent).

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers.

They play the middle. They don't hold the loans. They don't employ bankers. They use independent brokers. They are transactional, and there is ALOT of transactions in this current low interest economy.

Homeowners deal with the company's loan servicing department. Founded in 1986, United Wholesale Mortgage is headquartered in Pontiac, Michigan, and is one of the top wholesale lenders in the country.

Ok, cool but what makes them special?

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), the #1 wholesale mortgage lender, set a company record of $107.7 billion in mortgage loan volume in 2019, more than doubling it’s 2018 production of $41.5 billion. In doing so, it broke the wholesale industry record of $103.3 billion of mortgage loan volume previously set in 2005 by Countrywide Financial. UWM also secured the title of #1 wholesale lender for the fifth year in a row which has never been done before in the industry.

These guys are literally the McDonalds of mortgages. Their rates are the lowest, their fees are the lowest, and they are the most competitive all around. Their growth and numbers prove it. 

Now before you wet your pants with excitement. 2021 will see some downturn in the housing market due to foreclosures. This may or may not effect the mortgage industry on paper, but it could drive down sentiment. So if you have the patience, this is a solid play for long term with room for alot of growth.

Either way, if you don't buy the stock, you need to give these fuckers a call. 1.99% on a 30 year fixed if you qualify, and if you would save money by getting the mortgage refi, use that savings to buy the stock, then you don't have to come out of pocket. Your welcome. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",2020-12-05 10:44:47

Its a golf sporting equipment company that designs, manufactures, markets and sells golf equipment products, more specifically clubs and balls, also including accessories such as bags, gloves, and caps. But the company has now taken a huge step and expanding the ability to create revenue and bring more recognition to their brand, and finding a new way to target new golfers. THEY ACCQUIRED TOPGOLF.

&#x200B;

[They sell equipment for golf](https://preview.redd.it/a2bzny0juo361.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e342d886306a04a286e90fe170538a0fb6cf1e)

Topgolf is a global sports entertainment company. It is a game that anyone can play (and win). Score points by hitting micro-chipped golf balls at giant dartboard-like targets on an outfield. The closer you get your ball to the center or 'bullseye' and the further the distance, the more points earned. Making it competitive. Meanwhile they find ways to sell you food, beer, have a bar, sell merchandise, and host parties. Plus the locations across the country and world (UK and Australia) are really cool and look like something out of a sci-fi movie at night with all the cool lights. Below I posted pictures of the location. 

&#x200B;

Every time I have gone to this place day or night it is packed. Making reservations on a weekend night? Better fucking do it 14 months ahead of time if you even watch a shot at securing the reservation. They have 5 hour wait times on weekend nights and is open well into the morning and still have to turn away customers The place fucking sells and it is awesome. Way better then watching your wife fuck her boyfriend on a Friday night. These places are popular and are only going to grow as it is a fairly young acquisition. It was founded in the year 2000. Highly recommend you go to a Topgolf location, even my young non boomer ass who can't swing a driver to save his life thought it was a great time. Look at the fucking pictures and tell me you wouldn't take the family or boys out for a night to get fucked up and spend 100$ rather then 500$ because your broke ass keeps buying puts on TSLA. Well by doing this play....you can finally make enough money to afford a fun night at Topgolf and just maybe...MAYBE...your wife won't fuck her boyfriend for one night and give you a chance.  

&#x200B;

**Valuation and reasoning for the run up:** Calloway is a 2.15 billion mid cap stock right now. It has been at these levels before and has retard strength momentum right now as it is trading at around 23 dollars a share. Earlier a few weeks ago it was at 16$..this has the possibility to be the next fucking meme stock for wallstreetbets but you autists won't pile into it because it seems to good to be true...but once again this will make you money rather then donating it to the wall street rich guys through TSLA puts. **The fact that it acquired Topgolf is a gamechanger. It made 1.1 billion dollars in revenue in 2019 and has grown at a 30% compound annual rate since 2017.** has made this stock (ELY) a fucking game changer. Morgan Stanley put a $30 price target on this stock in the next year. 

&#x200B;

The only negative comment regarding the TopGolf merger I've seen is that ELY paid too much for the company, especially during a pandemic. This view is very shortsighted because back in 2017 ELY valued their 14% stake in TopGolf at a $2.1Billion valuation, which is before the company had 3 years of 30%/year growth. Other than the weak overvaluation argument, the analysts are unanimous in calling the TopGolf deal transformational to ELY and expect the company to deliver strong growth for many, many years. A vaccine or treatment for the virus should arriving soon, which would make the TopGolf deal suddenly undervalued again and send ELY shares to new highs. TopGolf is currently in hypergrowth mode, especially with their Top Tracer business which is only 1% penetrated worldwide. I listened to the merger conference call and it was obvious that the ELY CEO was being overly conservative in his projections, it sounded like the EBITDA projections he was giving was the bare minimum that the combined business will achieve. Definitely and under promise, over deliver scenario here. 

TopGolf rakes in money. Now Callaway equipment will be in front of everyone that walks through those doors. I understand the dilution worries but they acquired TopGolf for an incredible price. Looking long term this is a great acquisition to help them broaden their footprint.

Time to go balls deep in LEAPS and monthlys.

PSA: I am not taking Stripe Public

Anyway, regardless of what your astrological signs say about a PSTH deal, ***no compelling case exists for Stripe to even rush to become public*** for a number of reasons:

* It has no shortage of private investor interest because it's disrupting the global e-payments industry
* In the words of John Collison, Stripe's ""still growing at startup-like rates and investing at startup-like rates."" John even said he thinks they will be ""continuing to operate in that mode for a few YEARS""
* Being listed would burden the company given the reporting requirements, transition, additional regulations, and would distract from Stripe's long-term vision
* John Literally Said 👏We 👏Have 👏No 👏Plan 👏To 👏IPO (and if you think that leaves a SPAC merger on the table, read this article [https://www.independent.ie/business/stripe-co-founder-john-collisonis-bullishon-post-brexit-uk-andsays-no-ipo-or-banking-planned-39818524.html](https://www.independent.ie/business/stripe-co-founder-john-collisonis-bullishon-post-brexit-uk-andsays-no-ipo-or-banking-planned-39818524.html))

Ultimately, Stripe will go public. But not now, not with PSTH's $5B, and not in Ackman's specified timeframe. By the way, John Collison mocked PSTH on Twitter. Don't pester people. ([https://twitter.com/collision/status/1326640110373367811](https://twitter.com/collision/status/1326640110373367811))

If PSTH and my call options tank because the Collisons formally reject all this ""SPAC-ulation"" I'll be disappointed to say the least. Be patient.

With the new flight award, ATSG projects that its airlines will operate 38 767s for Amazon Air by April 2021, 36 of which CAM leases to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

In exchange for the commitment for 12 more leases, Amazon will receive 7 million warrants to purchase ATSG stock, increasing its potential ownership stake to 38%. If Amazon leases five more aircraft under the 2018 deal, its equity stake in ATSG could reach 40% — double the investment rights granted in the initial 2016 partnership. So far, Amazon has not exercised any of the warrants granted by Wilmington, Ohio-based ATSG.

I believe this is a strategic acquisition target for AMZN, as they have made a strong push into their own delivery and owning the process end to end. From delivery to the distribution centers to delivery to the customer. 

https://cheddar.com/media/amazon-replacing-usps-with-own-delivery-network

Based on their growth with ATSG and their potential 40% ownership stake - it is a logical progression and one I’m betting on.

ATSG is a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air cargo transportation and related services to domestic and foreign air carriers and other companies that outsource their air cargo lift requirements. ATSG, through its leasing and airline subsidiaries, is the world's largest owner and operator of converted Boeing 767 freighter aircraft. Through its principal subsidiaries, including three airlines with separate and distinct U.S. FAA Part 121 Air Carrier certificates, ATSG provides aircraft leasing, air cargo lift, passenger ACMI and charter services, aircraft maintenance services and airport ground services. ATSG's subsidiaries include ABX Air, Inc.; Airborne Global Solutions, Inc.; Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc., including its subsidiary, Pemco World Air Services, Inc.; Air Transport International, Inc.; Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc.; and Omni Air International, LLC.

DD,SPLK vs ESTC Part V,22,k882ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k882ax/splk_vs_estc_part_v/,8,1607338280.0,"4 months ago, before Q2 earnings, I started a  [🌈 🐻 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iijc4h/coverage_on_splk_part_iv_aftermath/) coverage on SPLK, comparing it to ESTC 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6jc7j/coverage\_on\_splk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6jc7j/coverage_on_splk/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wrpv/coverage\_on\_splk\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wrpv/coverage_on_splk_part_2/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iea6hk/estc\_and\_splk\_earnings\_next\_week\_826\_amc\_saas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iea6hk/estc_and_splk_earnings_next_week_826_amc_saas/)

Although ESTC doesn't compete directly with SPLK, certain market segments do overlap. Analyzing the SPLK tech stack, their moat is not in visualization nor data interface, but it's in making huge amount of data easily searchable and able to be aggregated, something ESTC does better.

On post Q2 earnings, the analysts were saying

[https://www.yahoo.com/news/splunk-slips-pre-market-revenue-095557873.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/splunk-slips-pre-market-revenue-095557873.html)

>“While optically it may seem as if SPLK missed its revenue target, cloud ARR is heading in the right direction which is the important metric investors should focus on,” Eyal wrote in a note to investors. “We expect SPLK to maintain a strong pace of revenue growth for some time to come, driven by growth in its cloud business, and we believe the company should be able to expand margins through operating leverage and efficiency gains""

My thought on this was

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iijc4h/coverage\_on\_splk\_part\_iv\_aftermath/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iijc4h/coverage_on_splk_part_iv_aftermath/)

>""Bullshit, they paint it as if nobody can sell software anymore except as a cloud SaaS, this is definitely not the case. Look at ESTC, non cloud rev still growing along with top-line""

Then when Q3 results came in, everybody was acting surprised with some even filing lawsuits against SPLK

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/why-splunk-stock-was-slammed-on-thursday/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/03/why-splunk-stock-was-slammed-on-thursday/)

>""Splunk's Q3 results and management's guidance for Q4 were both well below analysts' expectations. Revenue came in at $559 million, down 11% year over year. On average, analysts were expecting revenue of $613 million. Splunk also reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.26 -- far behind the $0.09 per share in profit analysts had been modeling for.""

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-splunk-inc-investigated-152200094.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-splunk-inc-investigated-152200094.html)

>""JPMorgan, who was “blindsided by the magnitude of too many large deals slipping in the final days of October.” Shares are presently down approximately 25% from their December 2, 2020 closing price, representing billions of dollars in lost market capitalization.""

Why they all act surprised when Q3's results continues Q2 's trend and the stock plummeted 25% is beyond me. I'm guessing since SPLK is such a fund darling, they were stalling until they can divest enough to the retail crowd and state pension funds before revising the price target.

My main gripes with all the sell side analyst covering SaaS cloud companies, is that they always take a braindead cookie cutter MBA analysis of the company, just focusing on ARR and RPO without taking into consideration the Tech/operational side of the product. However for SPLK case, it was pretty obvious even from  Q2's financial results that their cloud ARR growth, which cost them a lot more compared to traditional licenses, won't make up for the declining on-prem license revenues

https://preview.redd.it/wc19qrxoho361.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3ede9b4d9ef04da261f8080cae8b35bff026417

In Contrast to ESTC, which recorded revenue rise across the board even in traditional on-prem license revenue

https://preview.redd.it/uf7wkczpho361.jpg?width=593&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e34b9c463d736a301f574c55c3648215b20a24ea

From an IT management perspective, for a CIO/CSO, ESTC have made it possible for literally almost anybody to implement SPLK-like functionality in their IT-OPS environment. Rather then buying expensive SPLK cloud or on prem license,just use ESTC opensource or buy the basic license, and have either someguy in bangalore or poland to implement the visualization and data interface for 150 bucks a day.

An ESTC base license + 40 man days at cheap outsourcing rate, you'll get a solution 2x as flexible as SPLK at 10 percent of SPLK's TCO.

# TL,DR: Long ESTC PT 160, SHORT SPLK PT 110",2020-12-07 05:51:20

DD,Why your next stock purchase better be HYLN,173,k853fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k853fe/why_your_next_stock_purchase_better_be_hyln/,244,1607327584.0,"**I MEANT CALLS FUCK**

Many of you know that the next big move in EV's is who can take the biggest share of the transportation industry. I'm not talking about your mom taking you to the nearest autism center, I'm talking about the transportation of moving your favorite fidget spinner into your Gay Bear hands.

**Why HYLN when Tesla providing trucks soon you fuck???**

Very simple answer, Tesla trucks are nice and all but they have two major limiting factors. 
1.	The truck range is only 500 miles (Hyliion's ERX is 1300 miles)
 2. CHARGING A SEMI IS NOT THE SAME AS CHARGING YOUR MODEL S E X OR Y. 

Many reports have come out that state that to charge a tesla truck, it would require revamping entire grids to support those key charging areas. Now imagine when you have to deliver something to bumfuck nowhere, aint gonna be no efficient chargers. The technology just isn't there yet. 

https://www.greenbiz.com/article/electric-truck-fleets-will-need-lot-power-utilities-arent-planning-it

Ok, what does Hyliion do to ""solve"" this problem. Simple. They use natural gas. NATURAL GAS??? WHAT? Yes natural gas. There is already 700+ natural gas stations around the United States, that means that it can easily travel anywhere it needs to, and it is much easier to establish new natural gas stations than it is to revamp electrical grids for tesla chargers, (think of how long its taking to fix flint's water) 

Additionally, it uses an onboard generator under the hood so that when you are driving, IT IS ALSO CHARGING THE BATTERY, this means that the range of a hyliion ERX truck is 1300 miles with an increased payload than Tesla's semi truck. You probably don't know this but many truck companies send out truck drivers in pairs, because of regulations, one drives while the other rests. With tesla trucks you can't do that since it only goes for 500 miles, they would need to stop and charge, while hyliion ERX truck will keep on going.

Also Hyliion's products are actually net negative carbon emissions. HOW? When cows fart, they give off methane (a pollutant), which is used to create natural gas. As our population grows, more meat eaters, more cows, more methane. Natural gas takes methane out the air and powers shit. Hyliion uses natural gas, that means using hyliion products not only produce clean efficient energy, you are also rapidly removing methane out of the air, a net negative carbon emission.

Now their current amazing product that Hyliion produces is that they  convert the rear axle of EXISITING TRUCKS to electric. Many companies do not want to do the jump in EV because they have already spent millions on their existing trucks. Well that whole market is up for grabs for hyliion because their product will give those existing trucks a 10-30% fuel cost reduction and will give them more torque and power so that when they go up hill, they have a much easier time than now. Additionally they use algorithms to help the driver get the most efficient drive possible and gives them points, think of a mini game for those truckers. 


**Yo autismo, I just saw their stock and it dipped massively recently, what happened???**

Hyliion on November 30th announced that they will redeem their public warrants. Now some people can say that's bad, others say that they are using that extra ~~144 million that they will receive to finish up their infrastructure etc. Either way, do you want to buy on a day its up 50% or do you wanna buy when the stock is red???

NOW IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THE STOCK FOR LOW PRICES.

The stock had a 20-40% short ratio against it in the past week, and it refused to break the $18 support level. It is itching to go up from here once the news of the warrants are settled. 

I am in at 100 shares and buying 600 more in the upcoming days NEXT YEAR DATED CALLS

TLDR: YOUR NEXT STOCK PURCHASE BETTER BE HYLIION DO NOT MESS UP ON THE NEXT TESLA TRAIN. BUYBUYBUY

* More filter options, including external linking to different financial websites (RH included).
* Sentiment scores for each post, with emoji indicators using weighted sentiment score for each ticker.
* Improved ticker parsing. Instead of trying to parse as many tickers as possible from OP’s, it determines the primary ticker for each OP instead. In other words, each post is associated with one ticker now. And instead of “ticker mentions” it uses upvotes for (fake) shares. If you’re reading this and you plan on writing up a DD or sth in the future, putting “ticker: \[ticker name\]” in your post somewhere will automatically qualify the post for that ticker.
* New set of columns —> shares, average cost, current price, total return. That’s right, I was able to get the approximate price of each post by using the price of the ticker at open/close (whatever was closer to the posts timestamp). See site footer for details on how each column is calculated.
* Open-source. Repo’s been made public and a github link’s been included for anyone wanting to contribute.

Let’s talk about this and the latest stock market news**

Hey everyone! So let’s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.

We saw more than ¾ of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth.

The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.

[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.

The VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.

For the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.

The big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.

Here are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.

So, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies … aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months.

So, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.

This may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don’t agree on.

This is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.

Yes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don’t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.

Yes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.

Other numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.

The other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.

So next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.

I own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don’t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.

We will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.

So, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.

DD,All we want for Christmas is more Kohl. The bullish case for retail giant KSS,73,k7zdvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7zdvz/all_we_want_for_christmas_is_more_kohl_the/,39,1607309098.0,"My fellow mentally challenged brethren, it's time to lick our wounds from last week and ~~lose~~ make some more money.

Hopefully a few of you were able to benefit from my [SPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9wlle/simon_property_group_spg_is_about_to_lift_off) post a couple months back.     Lately, aside from getting my lunch and shirt stolen by PLTR I have been [playing options ](https://imgur.com/a/jzSJxrL)around the insane [Kohl's comeback](https://i.imgur.com/8tx1CBf.png) (and retail/REIT's in general tbf) that has seemingly gone completely unnoticed here.  Now, I do believe we are in for a week of market consolidation very soon all around, but I have reason to believe Kohl’s will continue trending towards pre-corona highs over the next 2 months and potentially all time highs over the next 1.5 years.

Hear me out autists, we should all want some Kohls in our stockings this Christmas.

# KSS is not done climbing.

First off, in case you missed it: **Kohl’s (KSS) is up +25% the PAST WEEK  and 92% over the PAST MONTH**. *What the fuck? -* is right my friend. - KSS currently trades at $40.90 after finishing an absolute burner of a week on the heels of [announcing their new combination store](https://www.barrons.com/articles/kohls-stock-sephora-coming-kohls-stores-51606836094) deal with Sephora makeup, you know that expensive lipstick your wife puts on to meet her boyfriend but wont touch for you? Ya them, they are coming to a Kohl’s stores near you next year and trust me when I say this: **The full scope of the increased customer exposure between Sephora and Kohl's Amazon Return program has not been fully realized by the market yet**,  they are still criminally undervalued by -25% from where they were before Coronavirus in spite of returning to profit in Q3.

**Store retail is not dead you fucking idiot**

Kohl’s is a fucking comeback champion.   If you think in-store retail is dead or on the verge of dying, then you actually need to get out of your basement at least once next weekend to [see for yourself](https://i.imgur.com/nKMPFZF.jpg) how alive and well it is. KSS has emerged several times in the past through various economic downturns- they were among the first retail giants to weather the 2009 recession and return to value- and if you have use of the brain behind that helmet you can see they are balls deep with a massive veiny erection as they do it once again.

&#x200B;

**Post-Pandemic Retail Consolidation favors the big boys**

They have already made and absorbed all the necessary changes and costs to maintain an open store in the face of the pandemic and somehow maintained a cash positive balance sheet on the year despite losing out on nearly a quarter of shopping days this calendar year.   Bullish AF\*

KSS is not sitting still while others have already fallen or shuttered - they have been among the most proactive department stores in adapting to the shifting consumer habits in the retail sector and I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised to see KSS reach all time highs (70+) by Q3 2022 or even sooner.

***Kohl's staying power has been solidified*** through this turmoil and the financial illiquidity of their competitors only presents less alternative consumer options. *(R.I.P JcPenney gang*)

&#x200B;

**MY TAKE**

My erection peaked for them during the last earnings call when the CEO reinstated the annual dividend which gave us the first clear internal indicator that they believe the worst is behind them.

>*Our third-quarter results exceeded our expectations with significant sequential sales and profitability improvement. We also further enhanced our financial position during the quarter, driven by solid operating cash flow.* ***We ended the quarter with more than $1.9 billion in cash and no amount outstanding on our revolver***\*. Based on the progress we are making and through disciplined capital management, we are pleased to share that we plan to reinstate a dividend during the first half of 2021\*. - Michelle Gass, CEO

The Sephora deal is a game changer for them bringing in an entire industry of shoppers that has also largely remained an in person shopping experience.  When women shop for clothes and makeup they still prefer not to buy on Amazon due to fit, size, and color inconsistencies.

**EARNINGS FOR NEXT QUARTER WILL EXCEED ANALYST EXPECTATIONS**

Earnings Momentum is a quirky nerd formula that measures the acceleration or deceleration of EPS growth over a trailing 12 month operating period - the upward curvature of the plotted points indicates that while earnings has predictably declined, due to a fucking pandemic, the most recent [EM chart](https://i.imgur.com/W3mlxOa.png) shows rapid acceleration in quarterly growth rate when adjusted for their earnings and market volatility.

**TLDR**: An improvement in future earnings growth, and a faster than expected full recovery is highly likely given their current trajectory of revenue return.   The new Sephora deal bringing positive/encouraging news, just before an expected Christmas retail run.  Investor sentiment is going to remain high and Nat King Kohl is about to bring Christmas joy to all of us.

&#x200B;

**PREDICTION:**

**KSS i**s about to flex towards pre-corona valuation levels in the next month of trading **(46.00+) (+15%)** and will continue on an upward climb to **55.00 (+40%) BY 12/2021**

**POSITIONS:**

**- 300 Shares @ 25.5**

**Shares will likely return +14-18% over the next 60 day trading window.**

[Options](https://i.imgur.com/wx2Mf5Y.png) **are extremely expensive right now due to the IV runup from last week, so look for a pullback or an overblown morning drop this week to enter anything before 1/8.**  Know that this play is safe so when the market starts tanking wait for your entry point

&#x200B;

**KSS 12/24 40c and 39c**

**KSS 1/8 40c**

**KSS 1/21/22  45c / 50c**

Godspeed retards, happy trading.  I am not going to load this up with rockets and space emojis because we're not immature children.  So instead, I leave you with some chart analysis

DD,Micron Technologies to the Moon,54,k7ygzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7ygzk/micron_technologies_to_the_moon/,36,1607306294.0,"So real old heads remember everyone's favorite meme stock from 2017. This bad boy was pulling in money left and right and was trading at a sexy P/E of under 14$. Micron Technologies was trading under 10 bucks before our man main entered the picture, Swag Master Sanjay Mehrotra in 2017 and ever since Micron Technologies has boomed to a beautiful 72$. So what is Micron technologies, and why is it going to make you rich:

&#x200B;

**What is Micron Technology?**

They're a company that specializes in producing NAND flash Semiconductors. Think the type of semi conductors used in your USBs, memory cards, cell phones and other small devices that lack the sizes for larger forms of dedicated storage. 

**What has been happening during the Rona**?:

Micron crashed in February in anticipation of a decline of the global NAND market due to Corona's effects on the supply chain. However this disrupted China's ability to flood the market with semi-conductors and as a result allowed Micron to gobble up a huge amount of the market share. Another [WSBs DD post put it better than I could](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7emhl/micron_technology_mu_dd/). Go read his post as well to get a better idea of what''s been happening over the last few months with Micron:

&#x200B;

>The memory trough has finally bottomed. Micron did not lose money. How do I know it has bottomed? Earnings from other tech companies. They have been investing in data centers because the new hot technology is AI. Artificial intelligence require massive CPU, memory, and storage. Magnetic disk is so 1980’s, it’s all about NAND today. Who makes the hottest NAND? Intel and Micron collaborated on 3D XPoint (think Intel Optane). It’s 1000x faster than NAND, last 1000X longer, and 10X as dense. It’s basically not volatile DRAM, something to power the AI revolution.  
>  
>  
>  
>Oh yeah, Micron just bought out Intel’s share of 3DXPoint for 1.5B. The only manufacturing for 3DXPoint is in… Utah. That’s right, not in China! So now I segue into the Mexican Beer virus. The majority of memory manufacturers are centered in the Wuhan area. The Wuhan area is basically shut down for the foreseeable future. Hmmm… which memory maker makes memory mostly outside China? If you said Micron, you win the prize. They have manufacturing locations in Idaho (you da hoe), Utah, Virginia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Xian China. They have only one location in China, and it’s not even in Wuhan.

Not only did Micron use Corona as an opportunity to expand its market share, [but the dip in NAND memory demand was temporary and it returned to its upward trend](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nand-flash-market-is-rebounding-faster-than-the-dram-market). Not only did demand increase; but the supply retracted as manufacturers in China and other Corona hit areas suspended operations as seen by this chart (you might have to click on it to see it closer)

&#x200B;

[Notice that oversupply is steadily declining](https://preview.redd.it/v8814125il361.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=820a650b6d82e238d8d9ffa53030961d59deeb68)

**Diversification and Innovation**:

[Here's an interview with the Swag Master himself:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLl3b7SMUBk) 

They've been able to make big bucks diversifying into data centers which have boomed with work from home and they've been making money on the online schooling trend. The demand for enterprise PCs has gone up. More or less every product that Micron Technology sells has boomed as a result of corona virus and they were able to achieve an Earnings Per Share growth of +77.55% since last year. They also will likely be used for the AI for self-driving cars so that's going to be exciting. We might even see a huge boom from them in the mid term once they start making deals with large EV manufactures. 

Not only have they seen growth in these new product lines but they've also come up with a new chip that should put them ahead of the competition for at [least a few years](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/micron-technology-just-announced-an-important-tech/):

>*176-layer NAND flash:*  
>  
>In the press release, Micron announced that it had begun volume shipments of the world's first 176-layer NAND flash chips. For those unfamiliar with NAND flash technology, it's becoming the nonvolatile storage medium of choice for many applications.  
>  
>  
>  
>Nonvolatile storage retains information even when power is turned off. Legacy hard disk technology still has a place in cheap bulk storage in cloud data centers. Yet cost reductions have made NAND closer to hard disk drives in terms of cost-per-bit, and with much better performance and resilience, less space, and better total cost of ownership in many cases. NAND flash is found in data center servers, smartphones, game consoles, and laptops these days.  
>  
>  
>  
>With the data revolution taking off, NAND flash demand is supposed to compound at a 30% annual growth rate. Yet many NAND manufacturers have had a hard time making profits in recent years despite that insatiable end demand. Companies have begun stacking NAND modules on top of each other in a 3D vertical structure, with each layer significantly boosting storage capacity. While demand for bits has gone up, the NAND flash producers have oversupplied the market, crashing NAND prices along with profits.  
>  
>  
>  
>However, Micron's innovation could give it a significant leg up on rivals next year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Why Micron Technology will grow after Covid**:

The big thing to realize is that Micron technologies has [some of the best chips in the market for handling the type of processing power that cell phones need](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution) for [5G and AI](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution). These guys are going to be miles ahead when 5G becomes the norm and the other companies will be trying to catch up for years. Don't take my word for it, trust everyone's favorite holocaust profiteers and Jeffery epstein's favorite bank, Deusche bank, who recently upgraded their outlook on them:

> In a research report, Ho said that Micron is expected to be a solid recovery pick as the economy starts recovering from the global pandemic. Demand drivers such as data centers, 5G smartphones, and gaming will accelerate the growth of Micron. Ho also pointed out that Micron is well-positioned for CY21 (calendar year 2021).   
>  
>Micron Technology is known as being a leading supplier and manufacturer of memory and storage used in a wide range of electronic devices ranging from PCs to smartphones. And the company is currently number three in market share for memory/storage shipments after Samsung and SK Hynix. DRAM currently makes up about two-thirds of the company’s total revenue with NAND making up most of the rest of the revenue.  
>  
>DRAM is known for providing high-speed data storage and retrieval. And NAND flash products are electrically rewritable and nonvolatile memory that retains data when power is turned off. This makes NAND ideal for mass-storage uses — specifically for solid-state drives, which have started to displace traditional hard disk drives.  
>  
>DRAM and NAND are both promising for the future as SSDs are expected to be used in the majority of PCs and data centers as well as higher memory and storage content in smartphones. And AI and autonomous vehicles will also require substantial DRAM and NAND capacities.  
>  
>Deutsche Bank is not the only brokerage to increase its price target on Micron. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently increased the price target from $56 to $70. And Morningstar equity analyst Abhinav Davuluri, CFA recently increased the target price to $50 per share from $48. And in an analyst rating consensus of Micron stock with 33 ratings, 76% say buy, 21% say hold, and 3% say sell.

They aren't the only institution that's upgrading their outlook. It'd take too long to go over all of the upgrades so I'm just going to link them:

Theres probably more that I'm missing but you dont need me to post every [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)/Seeking Alpha/Motley Small Bus Rider word vomit from 2 bit prop traders and amatuer hedge fund larpers to prove my point. This bad boi is going up bigly.

**The most important bit: How to trade**:

You guys can try making money with out of the money two week calls but I suspect that there are other ways to make money on this that might be more lucrative.

First of all shares. Yes they are boring but keep in mind there's a really, really good chance that Micron gets the Vale treatment in the near future and spikes on rumors of being able to supply one of the big EVs with chips. I'm not going to tell you when this might happen because no one knows. But I feel it in my heart of hearts and half of the analysts upgrading it mention how Micron's new chip is going to have massive applications with self-driving automobile technology and if you watched some of the interviews with the Swag Master he always brings it up. Sure it might not be TSLA since they are in bed with TSM but keep in mind if they choose to keep that deal proprietary and TSM doesn't sell that chip to anyone else that means that basically there are no other chips for EV companies to choose from other than Micron.

Second what I'd really recommend are Leaps. Buy yourself some 2022 out of the money calls and you will print money in due time. There are just so many upside potentials with Micron that if even one of them ends up working out then these leaps will print.

TLDR: Buy the 85$ January 2022 MU calls. You'll thank me later.",2020-12-06 20:58:14

No factories they are the middle men with patents that connect the producer and the customers. They have a factory now because of what they did on 3D sensing in 2018

Positives: it's making money in many areas all at once again. 8K TVs, chips in phones and laptops. The normal shits. The growing areas are automotives and 3D sensing for autobots 
decepticon type shit. Lmao. Security for homes, privacy protection and so forth.

They make chips so no need to raise money through stock offerings. In the future they will reinstate their dividend per year.

Negatives: Himax threw too much shit at 3D sensing for phones in 2017. Even threw $80 million+ to make a factory because everyone was unable to supply chips. It was in Apple iphoneX until Apple the gf left himax for some other dudes with bigger wangs.

Himax was in Google glass 2013 until that failed to gain traction. Himax was in Microsoft Hololens until that failed to gain traction. All these gfs left for bigger and better wankers.

Google has 6% of some stock in one of Himax subsidiaries from what seems like a century ago.

Short story: Himax made tons of dumb bets but now they are working on areas like security, privacy and automation for vehicles and big ass HD TVs that will grow every year along with their core businesses.

Analyst have it at $11 target. I would see $11 as cheap. Market cap of about $2 billion if it's at $11

Current price $6.80 it doubled recently.... From $3.

Advice: Buy stonks below $11, buy calls, sell puts. Sell calls when it flies. 2020 when everything seems to be overvalued. This is a nice gem to hold.

Target above $21... Wake me up when it happens.

I'm not a financial advisor so do not listen to me. But also you should fucking listen to me. If you make money like this post. If you lose money. Fuck me. I'll tattoo wallstreetbets on my ass if it doesn't get to $21 with the next decade.",2020-12-06 17:25:59

They are heavily shorted, 6 Millions shares plus (35,35% of tradeable shares, as 58% of Varta is owned by the Swiss company Montana Tech)
The whole premise of the short sellers is that asian competition will catch up and destroy Varta with cheaper prices, because some non Varta batteries where found in wireless headphones. They were used because Varta couldn't fulfill the demand (meanwhile production increased). This happened in January 2020, since then Varta crashed but already recovered to where it was at the start of the year. But as it seems no big competition entered the market, as forecasts where already raised 2 times this year and sales grew by 70% YoY. Next Years PE is expected to be 25. Short interest is above 40% so short sellers will be hesitant to add to their positions.

With all those factors the price could explode, maybe when they report their next earnings in February and short sellers decide to exit. Christmas sales should boost their sales too.",2020-12-06 17:22:39

From people who breathe steel fumes for highs:

""The result: Sources said it is probably only a matter of time before prices hit $45 per cwt, and several said $50 per cwt is a possibility within the next month.

US HRC prices have not been at $50 per cwt since September 4, 2008, according to Fastmarkets’ records. That’s more than 12 years ago and shortly before the September 15, 2008, collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered a financial crisis.

**Quote of the day**“It’s no longer trying to get an extra buck or two at a time. They are going to be asking for a heck of a lot of money,” one Gulf Coast steel consumer said. “When spot availability is this tight, the few pounds that they have to sell, they are going to get a really **beefy premium** for it.”

Just in case you retards can't read this, I will translate: STEEL MOONS.

The cherry on top is that bushelling prices are getting squeezed which benefits X. Bushelling is a scrap metal and the main ingredient for mini-mills to make steel; X's blast furnace shoots more coke and iron ores. If the competitors are setting prices, and their cost is increasing, X basically free-rides on the price increase while their cost structure is less impacted.

If X runs into 2007-2008 valuation, by my crystal fucking ball, share price shoots to $60/share. If the steel prices suck some tits and calm down, we can get into 2018's levels, with >$30/share.Every week I pound the table (and your gf) to buy United States Steel (NYSE: X), and every week you fuckers just label this as a boomer stock and fuck yourself over on free gains. Don't you get it, the SQUEEZE IS ALREADY HAPPENING.

Next week, when vaccine rolls out or stimulus bill is passed, X will continue its ascent to the stratosphere. Do you want to miss out on that rocket ship?

options IV is just 70% vs GME's retarded 140%. Short interest is 20%.

Whats happening behind these high number of shares sold short. I mean how does this even happen. Aren't brokerages supposed to secure the actual shares before they allow it to be shorted? Or these numbers are just off.   


Another question, whats the interest for shorting GME shares anyways.

DD,Why you should Short DOORTRASH,542,k8wgu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8wgu9/why_you_should_short_doortrash/,265,1607426955.0,"I worked for Doordash for nearly two years. I didn't get fired, and this post will be solid DD about how their business operations are dogshit, not me whining because I was underpaid or let go(tho I was underpaid).

**1) The fucking network goes down constantly, their tech is trash**

Go read /r/doordash_drivers or any other employee sub. AT LEAST once per month, on a Friday or Saturday night, the ENTIRE network goes down for at least 1 hour. What happens when the entire network goes down? All restaurants still have to be paid for the food they made, and all orders have to be refunded to customers, who also demand refunds because their tendies were late. Yes, sometimes companies shit is fucked, Facebook has an outage sometimes too. But it happens to Doordash constantly, BEFORE COVID doubled their order volume.

Regarding their tech - here's how the process is supposed to work.

1)You punch in an order for tendies.

2) The restaurant gets a little ping on their tablet saying ""Order? Ya takin this brah?"" (or, LMFAO, the Doordash CALL CENTER CALLS THE ORDER INTO THE RESTAURANT, YES, THEY REALLY DO THIS)

3) The restaurant clicks accept and starts making the food.

4) The Doordash Network does the travelling salesman optimization poorly and offers the order to drivers.

5) A driver accepts

6) The restaurant hits a ""confirmed rdy"" button and the driver, notified via text message comes in an picks it up.

At EVERY single point in this process, with regularity, I would see evidence that the Doordash system sent the process forward without confirmations. If a restaurant didn't turn their tablet on that morning? Doesn't matter, I'm at the restaurant now asking about an order that they never knew they had, but SOMEHOW confirmed it was ready - despite having a tablet with a dead battery. I'd have my phone in one hand with the ""Order Ready For Pickup at Tendie Shop"" text message in one hand, and be holding the restaurant's dead tablet in my other hand.

Customers would call me, two seconds after I left the store having hit ""Picked Up"", asking me where I was, because the app told them I was outside.

What happens when their network delivers confirmation notifications that are lies? Lost money.

Uber has algorithms that automatically price rides and orders. The price changes with demand. What does Doordash do? Charge the same for every order, and pay drivers ""boosts"" in minimum increments of a half hour. So what happens is every Friday or Saturday night, there will be a ""2$ boost"" on all orders from 5pm-9pm. But let's say the system is still saturated at 6pm - then they add a boost from 6pm-9pm for another dollar. But if it dies at 7pm, they can't take the boost off. And if it's overloaded on a Sunday, they basically never add one no matter what. I suspect this is because they don't have an algorithm, they have people they pay to look at network data live and make decisions (poorly).

**2) They don't know how to run a fucking business**

Repeatedly, I would be placed in situations where the simple and proper customer service thing to do was A, but because it saved half a dollar in the short run, I did B and fucked the customer over, because Doordash wouldn't pay me to do A.

Here's an example. New Year's Eve, 230am. I get a double order from a Chinese restaurant. One going way North, one going way South. I live North past the North order, gonna go home after.

The way double orders work is that drivers get paid a little less, because it's only one pick up. No problem, that's fair!

I get to the Chinese place. They have North order ready, but not South order. They say it will be 30 minutes for South order.

I call Doordash support (more on them in a moment). I explain that the next customer's order will be delayed.

Here are the possible outcomes :

A) Out of the kindness of my heart, I waste my gas (and miss out on pay!) to make North Customer happy, I deliver his order right now, and then come back and get South Customer's order.

B) I sit there for 30 minutes and let North Customer's order get (c)old because they won't pay me extra to deliver it separately, even though it's now two orders.

What do you think happened? They wouldn't pay me. I'm an ""independent contractor"", I don't run a fucking Doordash customer charity. North Customer's order got cold. I'm sure he bitched and complained rightfully, and Doordash had to refund his food. Doordash saved 6$ by not paying me, only to probably lose this customer and lose the order's revenue anyways.

Let's talk about support now. Every single restaurant I ever talked to regarding support would make me call about any issue, because the Restaurant Support line ALWAYS had a minimum 30 minute hold wait. They just didn't give a shit.

I've dealt with Uber, DD, Instacart, lots of different support callcenters for this shit. DD hires the Phillipinos that don't speak english well enough to work at the Uber call centre. I would have to hang up 1/5 times I called and call again, because the person I got could not fucking understand what I was saying. I don't have some kind of weird speech impediment either I s2g.

Their support are total idiots too. Here's a good one.

I try to deliver Chinese to some people. I hear loud music in their apartment. I knock ten times over 5 minutes. I text them twice. I call them three times in the same period. They won't come to the door.

I leave and go do the next order. Support calls me back, says hey, can you go deliver that order? They said they're sorry. I said sure, i'm only a few blocks away anyways.

I go back, same shit happens again, they don't come to the door. I leave again. Support calls me again 20 minutes later, I say this time I'm not going back unless they pay me extra, I've been back once for free already. Support says sure, we'll give you 5$.

I go back, and deliver the food. This time, they come to the door to get it, and the most obviously fucking spun up meth-head i've ever seen comes to the fucking door. I tell support ""Yo, you should ban these ppl from the app, they're high as fuck and wasting my time"". Support says ""That's a good idea, it says here they say their order didn't get delivered like half the time, probably scamming"".

Next week? I get an order from the same Chinese place to the same address, apartment number and all pop up in my app. Declined, so no problem for me. But DD? You can't ban cracked out scam artists who cost you money?

I could go on and on. Essentially in most instances, Doordash support fails to protect the long term interests of the company, which screws over good customers and lets scam artistry run rampant.

My friends are all hipster foodie millennials and Doortrash has the reputation among ALL OF THEM as the least reliable app, where the app doesn't work, their food goes missing or ends up 3hrs late for no reason. Nobody likes it.

**Doordash is what happens when someone starts a competitor, hoping to get bought out, and then they never get bought. Corona happens and they decide ""oh, maybe we can IPO then and that's how we get rich and get out of this mess?""**

TL;DR SHORT DOORTRASH

Positions, all stock, will be shorting DD with my GME profits soon enough.

-They make money speeding up drug research, the runway is massive and they aren't limited to one area of expertise like a standard biotech.

From Bloomberg: ""AbCellera screens, selects, and analyzes millions of naturally produced antibodies to find next-generation drug candidates, fast tracking an otherwise lengthy and cumbersome process with machine learning and data science. Aside from Thiel, the Vancouver-based company’s backers include German entrepreneur Christian Angermayer, Viking Global Investors and health-care investment firm OrbiMed Advisors LLC.""

DD,WISH IPO: A giant in the making.,36,k8vc5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8vc5d/wish_ipo_a_giant_in_the_making/,91,1607422890.0,"For those of you unfamiliar with the company, wish.com is the third largest e-commerce website in the United States and it has the most-downloaded shopping app in the world. 

Since 2018, the company’s revenue has more than doubled as it has perfected its targeted ad systems that tailors each social media ad to the customer it’s targeting. This is the reason for the ultra-specific ads you may be familiar with which cater to your profession, hobbies, interest, etc.

As of now the market is flooded with e-commerce sites like Amazon, which has the logistics market cornered, and Alibaba, which thrives on economies of scale. Wish.com brings its own unique benefit to the market, and that is in its proprietary ad-targeting algorithm, which operates similarly to the blockbuster app TikTok in providing content which targets the specific needs of the buyer.

I believe this factor alone sets Wish ahead of most of the e-commerce marketplace and could place them in the top three holders of global market share by 2025. 
In an inescapable age of information, information will continue to be the most valuable tool in securing buyers, and Wish has everyone beat in that department as of now.

I see this as an opportunity to get in on an Amazon or 
Alibaba initial offering. 

Before I go any further, I believe I should highlight that this is *NOT* a meme stock and it’s not more empty promises as we’ve seen in recent mergers and IPO’s. I think this is best evidenced by the players involved in this offering. The management of this company are not from retail backgrounds and this is not a retail company. At least not exactly. CEO Peter Szulczewski is an engineer from Google who **wrote the algorithm** for keyword search expansion. After leaving Google, he wrote an algorithm that analyzes browsing behavior to determine buying interests. When he realized how effective this algorithm was at suggestive selling, he put together a team including Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang. All this is to say that Wish is not just a retail company.

**Wish.com’s main product is not goods— it’s buyers**

I see the most difficult hurdle for Wish to cross as supply chain logistics. Since independent sellers can list items on the marketplace, questionable practices often take place with regard to quality of goods and shipment. Wish has made advancements with regard to shipping including and agreement between China Post and the USPS, but they are way behind Amazon in their shipping infrastructure. This is in part due to their reputation as a low-cost marketplace preventing them from investing in high-cost shipping. This issue will need to be resolved for them to become competitive on a global scale.

Lastly, Wish has established itself not only as a major player in the global market but as a stock that is here to stay. Reinvestments into infrastructure, alongside groundbreaking advancements in the science of targeting advertisements puts Wish on the forefront of global commerce. The foundation is there, but the company has tremendous shoes to grow into.  

Here’s my prediction for the stock:

I believe the initial public offering will be the largest of this year, AirBNB included. I think as the funds become available, and if their worldwide shipping and customer service infrastructure are improved sufficiently, Wish could see a swift rise to become a household with few peers in market capitalization. Potentially one of the next trillion-dollar market cap stocks. I will be investing heavily at IPO. See you there.",2020-12-08 05:21:30

PLTR DD

Starting point**:** 

**RECENT EVENT REACTION**: Palantir's traction with large government contracts, such as its recent $44 million order with U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19 treatment approvals, could be a sign the company is finding success with expanding uses of its products beyond defense, terrorism threats, cybersecurity and fraud detection. Still, customer concentration and lack of a cloud-based subscription model could limit Palantir's revenue-growth visibility beyond 2021. (12/08/20)

1. Palantir: Company Outlook THESIS: Palantir's software use for contact tracing and supply-chain analysis during the pandemic could be a tailwind for top-line growth and new-customer additions in the near-term. While the company's addressable-market view remains clouded by its lack of a partner ecosystem and reliance on large government customers for sales, we believe Palantir's proprietary datasets and shortening deployment times could help broaden its potential uses and diversify the customer base. Investments in building direct services 

**Valuation Unlikely** to Match Cloud IPOs Palantir is unlikely to garner a valuation similar to pure-play cloud-software IPOs, which averaged a 65% gain in their public-market debuts. While the company has strong intellectual property, built around the use of big data for its analytics offering, we believe its top-line growth in the $26.5 billion analytics tools software market could be limited by growing competition from stand-alone providers such as Tableau (bought by Salesforce.com) and Qlik, as well as hyperscale-cloud peers including Microsoft's Power BI and Amazon AWS. Palantir's lack of a partner ecosystem limits its operating-margin expansion, in our view. The company's multi-class voting structure, with a majority of voting rights for its co-founders, and a lack of customer diversification could hurt institutional interest. (09/29/20)

However in my report of PLTR I strongly believe that it has the momentum for the next quarter to strongly outperform the news and it could be traded at an overvalued price for much longer, and because of this short term profits could be made on this investment. 

Fundamental 

[Figure 1 ](https://preview.redd.it/g6m3pl14yu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=318c5c280ec41cd92ab20d6abe9e360779e92eb6)

We can see that in the sector that they are in they are performing better than the competition in terms of sales Their EBIT is quite high and their p/e rate is lower than the competition. If we look at the recent sales and buys done we can see that the rate of institution ownership went up quite a bit. This is in fact good news for us. And we can see growth from here.

[Figure 2 ](https://preview.redd.it/xhxbebu9yu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ebe37d79b17578b839301d986f93ba44bf2b463)

&#x200B;

a) The operating income is almost double in loss but this should not discourage the prediction because it’s a new IPO and they are using their money to grow their operations so this would be expected. The total debt increased however this is also due to the rapid growth of the company and them expanding 

**What does the company do?** 

Data analytics is their prime focus since IPO earlier this year they have +160% after announcing their FDA response and the company working with news on working with Greece with their covid-19 response they have gained 20% today The stock is up big on Monday after the company reportedly won a new FDA contract to use Palantir software to help the agency conduct drug reviews. The software will help the FDA with drug approvals, including potential COVID-19 treatments.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp also joined Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on a teleconference to discuss Palantir's partnership with Greece to support COVID-19 response efforts. Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help guide decisions on how to best deal with the crisis.

**The ownership** 

of institutions is up by 2% and the # of buys is up by 100% indicating to us that the market is deciding to go long on this stock. These are all bullish indicators and tell us a story; a story of going to the moon. 

b) Other investments made to the company are all up and long on the stock. 

c) This shows us the ownership of the company. 

[Figure 4 ](https://preview.redd.it/cazcwwclyu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=803bbd3c253b0bfe0b5604523637c3743b5f456a)

**Insider Purchase sales** 

We can see at the rally 2 weeks ago that insider selling was high this could indicate to us that there where massive sell off however as I previously mentioned there is momentum to the stock and that the news of many insider selloffs didn’t effect the rally tells us that this stock has the potential to go even higher. I would suggest that these sell offs where purely psychological and they where done by people that invested their money since the company IPO mostly from within the company so this does not indicate to us that the price would go down. 

[Figure 5 ](https://preview.redd.it/43m30xvnyu361.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4f00fabf1feb1fae7ae70ba746ebc417bc95316)

&#x200B;

**Sells of PLTR** 

The majority of the institution holders were selling at the rally last week. However, they didn’t sell completely and decreased their position size. This is just because its part of their trading strategy and when there is a rally that big in order to hedge the massive investments they have to do a partial sell ofs of their position. They would eventually buy back in at the next rally because there is just enough momentum to keep the stock going higher( they are just buying the dips) 

[figure 5 ](https://i.redd.it/3y755zdryu361.gif)

 

**Earings report** predictions say that the earings are matched with the stock growth and this should b an indicator that the company is performing in touch with reality and that it is not that overvalued at this point of time and that the extrinsic value that is brought to us by the recent news would rally this stock higher. 

Operating profit to stock price.

**Supply Chain**

In the supply chain of PLTR 

We can see that their top 10 competitors are doing similar in their sector and that their majority customer is the US government which makes them a reliable source because they have unlimited money :P so they would pay regardless. This supply chain is fairly simple however it creates a better foundation for the companies foundation. 

In short, I think that the PLTR has more room for growth and we can expect $40-45 by end of Q1 and I am in a long bullish position for this company,

I was just looking into cheaper EV stocks and came across $FSR. I really like the Fisker Ocean and I think it could be nice competition for Tesla’s Model X in terms of aesthetics and price. 
Model X price - $80,000
Ocean price - $37,500

Model X range approx- 350 miles 
Ocean range 250 - 300 miles
 
Model X 0 -> 60mph - 2.6 seconds 
Ocean 0 -> 60mph - 2.9 seconds

Currently there are more than 10,000 reservations for the Ocean, so there’s a pretty nice demand for it. What’s your take on it?

DD,Toyota is finally joining the EV Party,38,k8ruu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8ruu0/toyota_is_finally_joining_the_ev_party/,37,1607411040.0,"Toyota is developing an electric SUV for Europe. They confirmed that the vehicle is “being reading for production.” They are building this from the ground up, so they are already ahead of companies like NKLA. I believe that they’ve already released an EV in China with joint venture with Panasonic. Toyota has been making hybrid (partially electric) vehicles for around 20 years so I would think that that gives them a foundation to build from for their EV sector. 

Source: https://electrek.co/2020/12/07/toyota-electric-suv-battery-electric-cars/

Toyota’s vehicles are reliable and their stock price is not ridiculously high. I could see this EV venture giving their stock price a boost, just like the announcement of GM’s hummer gave them a rise. Personally I’d buy an EV from Toyota rather than GM because of my faith in their products.

TLDR: KNDI is a circle-jerk scam of Chinese meme gods that is bound to leave a bukkake-sized load on the face of the EV industry before its delisted and the execs are sent to gulags.

Position: $5P exp 6/18/21. Enter when the stock is between 10-11 and expect to average down until these motherfuckers are pocket change. Then wait.

Now, before the actual DD, I implore you to simply google what KNDI’s product is. It looks like the minivan and a Smart Car were somehow cousins and KNDI is the autistic offspring. And you retards think this has a shot against all the cybertrucks this sub is going to run them over with? Good luck. I’d take TSLAQ level losses on this play before you could pay me to cash out on a KNDI vehicle with my tendies.

I’m going to be upfront, if you’re interested in this play, read the Hindenburg Research reports. This dd is moreso about the feasibility of KNDI in scaling, which presents significant risk to investors, which given that they haven’t been able to raise a market cap at all yet, means they never will.
The number one claim to fame this stock has is that it made the cheapest EV. Cool. It’s almost like the Chinese didn’t yet have a reputation for flooding the American market with cheap goods. The problem with that business model in this application, is that it has to present a feasible alternative to its competition. And if you think for a single fucking second that this company can compare with Meme Lord Elon, youre an even gayer bear than I am. 
So in addition to not being able to sell to American consumers, it appears they can’t even sell to Chinese consumers either. Essentially, it’s extremely likely that their balance sheets and revenue are completely fraudulent, and that the execs of the company have literally just been buying their own cars and counting it as sales. The reasoning for fraud is that the company has been through three auditors already, and one of them is banned from ever auditing in China again after fucking up harder than you retards fumble earnings calls.

Summary: Making dirt-cheap products with negative margin, cooking the books on sales, and pocketing stacks off of ‘Murican investors pulling for hype over fundamentals. Sounds like it’s going to the moon to me.",2020-12-08 01:25:12

DD,This is the way to play Tesla (up 55.8% TODAY with this dumb strategy!),32,k8odde,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8odde/this_is_the_way_to_play_tesla_up_558_today_with/,36,1607400595.0,"Elon Musk says we need to double the world's electricity by 2040. How is that going to happen--Solar? No. Wind? No. 

The only way to ramp up base-load capacity so quickly is more natural gas, coal, or nuclear plants.  Natgas and coal are out because they aren't green. Nuclear is the best option.

Here's the quick and dirty DD:

To get nuclear plants going, we need to mine uranium. Uranium stocks have roofed the last two trading sessions because congress just passed a bill to start a US stockpile of the stuff for national security purposes. The scramble to get mines operational has begun, but that's only the trigger that will set off a much longer rally based on industry-specific factors. 

The fact is, the world is set to go into a decade-long drawdown of uranium inventories. Despite the Fukushima disaster last decade, nuclear capacity will continue to grow year after year, but mines aren't keeping up. That's going to set the price of uranium soaring, from around $30 per pound today, to $50 or even more, so that mines actually get paid to produce.

Uranium mining companies like Cameco (CCJ in the US exchange and CCO in Canada) are levered to the price of uranium, so that when the uranium price rises, the stock prices rise even more. And with options, idiots like us at WSB can be levered on top of that leverage. The daily gains can be explosive. 

That's how I made 55.8% today: options on CCJ. See the screenshot. A good chunk of these options were out of the money when I bought them, but now they're all in the money. What can I say--sometimes the idiots at WSB do win! I should have bought even further out of the money, like CCJ 14 Jan 21 calls, given the pace the underlying is currently moving.

Positions: Lost almost all my portfolio due to palantir so I could only do  55c 24,2020  at 1.28

AZN is a multinational pharmaceutical and biopharma company with over 70k employees. Before I even start let’s look at its revenue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gz9qt80smt361.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa13fc08771057a10d27bed1b57fae4826b04324

You can see that it has been consistently profitable while also maintaining growth. It had a net income of around 1.2 billion dollars in 2019. Now you might say this is a hold stock. Well that’s true. You can do your own dd for its vaccine  but rn its kinda shit. It  has  weird results and allegedly stated “it administered the wrong dose amount” yet that resulted in a 90%.

“The vaccine stopped an average of 70% of participants from falling ill, an [early analysis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QK8M480C92BS) of the data show. The effectiveness rose to 90% for one of two regimens, using half a dose followed by a full one later, close to the high bar set by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc.”-Bloomberg

Now if they are able to do something and establish a better foothold the stock will probably skyrocket. So far the vaccine has been priced in however the vaccine has been priced in by how much it sucks so if they are able to do anything to increase it to around the 95%< mark I think they will become a major footholder in the vaccine race. However, that is a big if so fuck that don’t be retarded and take the risk. I want to focus on something that will make you retards quickckkkk money. On december 20 AZN and its partner Fibrogen Inc. have a pdfua set for the drug Roxadustat. It is an oral pill which is used for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease with anemia. Now there are around “more than 37 million American adults may have CKD,1 and it is estimated that more than 1 out of every 7 people with kidney disease have anemia. Most people who have kidney failure—when kidney damage is so advanced that less than 15 percent of the kidney is working normally—also have anemia.”-[www.niddk.nih.gov](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/)

With this a 37 million reach just in America is no joke. If this is approved the smallest dose of Roxadustat (10mg) goes for 60USD. So their new market just in the US is a cap of 2,220,000,000 dollars….. Now I could go into the chemistry for this however I think those who actually read this will do their own dd into it. So let’s get into if this will pass or not. Now I am telling you this it is 95% going to be approved. 

Why? 

Roxadustat is currently approved in China for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD, regardless of whether they require dialysis, and in Japan for the treatment of dialysis patients with anemia of CKD. FibroGen’s partner Astellas also intends to file a marketing authorization application with the European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2020.

\-biospace

Also, if you want more proof the fda didn’t even have to hold a advisory meeting for this and its establishment as a working treatment with little to no side effects has already been established. So if this passes. Fibrogen Inc with ticker Fgen will actually skyrocket and AZN will as well through direct partnership and the fact that they are going to commercialize together. So you can get into whichever ticker you wish tbh but I chose AZN. This comes out december 20,2020 so positions for December 24 will be good and I am a bit skeptical for AZN long term growth for their vaccine but for this quick pump and maybe not dump I would recommend buying a couple of options at least. 

Most recent news:

AZN is looking to get emergency approval for its covid vaccine and since India is corrupt it will probably go through ;however, they will not have the same reach as pfizer due to their weird ass results

This article points out that upper management never planned to permanently close any locations; I believe this was a major mistake as they could have used this pandemic to trim their less profitable locations and focus on improving their money makers. This means they have just been paying all the expenses on these properties while they don't make them ANY money.

the company just sold a bunch of this shit called junk bonds to keep them above water. I don't know about you, but selling shit bonds because your business can't make money doesn't seem like a winning long term recovery strategy.

The stock jumped 28% after news of the COVID vaccine came out; not out of any boost in the valuation of the company. When the earnings come out this week, we will truly see how badly Dave Busted. This is going to drive the stock down, and I think we should all collectively short this little bitch.

DD,Why Canoo is Ahead of All Other EV SPACs and Will Change the EV Market,126,k8mdsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8mdsj/why_canoo_is_ahead_of_all_other_ev_spacs_and_will/,113,1607394791.0,"**A Quick Intro:**

Canoo is an EV company going public through an SPAC merger later this month. Their 1st vehicle will begin mass production in 2022. You can look at it [HERE](https://www.canoo.com/design/)

It plans to offer it's product (vehicles) through a subscription based model. These subscriptions could be 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1+ year, etc. The subscription includes the vehicle, registration, maintenance, charging, and access to insurance.

**What Puts Them Ahead?**

There's a few things that do. The easiest to see is the fact that they have a product. Their first van type vehicle(aka the BangBus) has already went through 50 crash tests and has actually been driving on the  highway.

The most exciting fact is the **Skateboard Design.** First watch [THIS](https://youtu.be/8m3fRujSlW0). The skateboard is essentially everything that makes the car go. Combine this with their steer by wire design(frees up a ton of space and can be put anywhere) and you have everything you need to make the car drive in the floor of the vehicle. This means for every model they're just adding the top ""shell"" to the skateboard and BOOM: you have a vehicle. Once they finalize the skateboard design(which they pretty much have done) then they can pump out new EV models like nothing. I'm talking delivery van, pickup truck, sports car, sedan, etc. [This picture sums it up](https://i0.wp.com/alabamanewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Canoo_Design_Exterior_Possibilities.jpg?ssl=1) All they have to do is the design work, slap it on the skateboard, and run some tests.

Their **Subscription Based Model** makes electric cars available to a a whole new market. This includes people who don't want to fully buy/own a car. The monthly fee covers literally everything so it's perfect for them. It includes people who can't afford to buy an electric car. The subscription model lowers the price of owning an EV, making it accessible to more customers. And then since it's easier for them to make new models, they may be the first to put an electric delivery van or pickup truck on the market. This would attract a TON of retail businesses/people.

Now the rest is **Purely Speculative** but there are plenty of potential deals that may arise that make a lot of sense. The most being an **Uber** or Lyft deal. The subscription model makes Canoo vehicles perfect for Uber drivers. No gas expense, no maintenance fee, won't have to dirty your own car, etc. And Uber could then play this up in advertising by saying many of their drivers ""drive electric"".

This is another popular one but a shot in the dark. **Apple** has been wanting to get into the EV game for awhile. Canoo would be the perfect target for an investment. An innovative product that rethinks how vehicles are traditionally made and sold. It's not like Apple has ever made anything like that before...........

**The Stock Itself:**

Canoo has largely been under the radar until the past week or so. They have a lot of good things happening this month, which could serve as major catalysts. They're unveiling their delivery van on December 17th, voting on the merger on the 21st, and who knows what else might happen. Canoo is being valuated at $2.4 billion through this merger, which is criminally low. The only way I see this company going is up from here on out.

[Watch this is you want to feel as confident as I am in this company](https://youtu.be/9F_W8pev4XQ)

TLDR; Shares, Warrants, Calls. They all go.

Edit: Forgot to add that they have an engineering contract with Hyundai and Kia to help them develop a skateboard for their Electric line of cars. An EV company with a product AND revenue?? Is this possible? Also there's already 15,000 reservations for it's van with no marketing",2020-12-07 21:33:11

Strap yourself to this rocketship for some RTard Level 5 TENDIES! 💥 🚀,8,k8mcra,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8mcra/psec_ftw_strap_yourself_to_this_rocketship_for/,37,1607394703.0,"Gather round fellow autists! I have a story to tell. I recently happened upon a lil ol thing called $PSEC. Prospect Capital, that's right! This is a BDC which doesn't stand for Big Dong Cashmaker (not ***YET*** anyways) but I digress. This is a Biz Development Company. Which means a couple of *very* important things, so listen closely:

\- Businesses make $ 

\- Developing Business def makes beaucoup $$$

\- These BDCs are regulated by the SEC and are req'd to pass 90% of profits to shareholders. 

\- This is a stonk. Stonks only go up. 

\- Literally can't go tits up.

\- Money is good. me want. 

These mfers still haven't *fully* recovered since the beer flu (which is practically over btw, thanks Biden!). BDCs pay a pretty generous dividend and essentially trade on their dividend. Well, PSC's dividend is back in action after a brief pandy pause. I checked their most recent earnings transcript b/c my autism was dropping one afternoon and as luck would have it their dividend isn't going anywhere but (maybe) up for the foreseeable future. This ~~Big Dong Cashmaker~~ Business Development Company is effectively paying nearly 15% annual dividend (paid monthly) rn. If the stock stays flat, you're still earning approx 15%. BUT BDCs essentially trade on their dividend; PSEC's dividend has fully recovered and their stock price has not. And w/ interest rates likely to rise you can expect to see the popularity of investment vehicles like this one grow yada yada yada derr derr WSB autism. stfu and let's get some tendiezzz!!!

Discussion,VTRS. Semi DD,9,k8mbhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8mbhc/vtrs_semi_dd/,6,1607394603.0,"Semi- DD: here me out.  Two large generic pharma companies merged (viatris) with a market cap of only 20B.  If you look back 5 years ago the market cap alone of the one (Mylan) was 30B +.  If you add in the Pfizer side, the market cap would have been another 30B.   The one side, Mylan, is easy to read into. Mylan struggled bc of poor executive management, poor PR, and troubles with the FDA.  However, with the merger, the majority of executives from Mylan are leaving.  The most important part of their 5 year decline was their two largest manufacturing sites were under fda warning letter for a couple years which inhibits their output from over 30 billion doses per year to roughly 8-10 billion.  With the warning letters lifted, manufacturing should pick up..  Above and beyond Mylan the Pfizer side of the deal brings a significant number of well known products such as Viagara... Additionally, the two merged companies expect serious cash flow (4 billion a year of which they will pay out 1 billion a year in dividends) immediately and within the next 30-45 days will detail a $1 billion dollar annual cost savings plan.  

If you evaluate the historical Pfizer target of a dividend of 4%, this means viatris believes their stock price should currently be $20.  But this price point and stated dividend is prior to their 1 billion in cost savings, prior to manufacturing picking up and prior to new products in New markets.  this company is set to deliver big returns.  

This stock is likely to double or more in the next 6-12 months.  Looking at the options for July 2021 specially the $22 strike price, you should be able to make a killing assuming the company remotely executes.  

To summarize a Viagara driven stock rally by a newly formed massive us based pharma company.  

Lastly they are yet to announce their dividend but it’s likely to be solid out of the gates.

Discussion,CRM/WORK Merger - A Spirited Monday Discussion,6,k8m69l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8m69l/crmwork_merger_a_spirited_monday_discussion/,3,1607394191.0,"Assuming the last post got deleted by mods because of the title...  

Ok, so I was long on WORK - left holding the bag following their IPO. With the recent acquisition announcement I broke even and then 6% return on top. Now WORK had been an eye sore in my portfolio and I was looking to cut my losses anyways so this announcement was a pleasant surprise and I can now get back my initial investment and some change. YAY.

“Under the terms of the agreement, **Slack** shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each **Slack** share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $27.7 billion based on the closing price of Salesforce's common stock on November 30, 2020,” the announcement reads.

So now I'm wondering... if someone was to ***hypothetically*** load up on WORK common stock now? Trading at $43.11 today - 2,000 shares for $86k. Based on the merger deal that breaks down as follows: 

2k \* $26.79 = $53,580

2k \* 0.0776 = 155.2 shares of CRM

Based on CRMs price today it would break even - maybe net a small return. One could likely hold CRM for a bit to maximize upside. What is the downside? CRM slides further and I one is back to being left holding a new, different bag?",2020-12-07 21:23:11

DD,Do you want to bet against reddit? I have the answers,60,k8lm63,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8lm63/do_you_want_to_bet_against_reddit_i_have_the/,19,1607392618.0,"I have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  For Friday’s expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570 – 590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650, 
* GME 20, 
* PLTR 25 - 40, 
* AMD 100, 
* SPY 370 - 380,
* APHA 9.  

The most popular puts that are out of the money are 

* NKLA 15, 
* PLTR 15 – 21, 
* NIO 40 
* ACB 7.  

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

Edit For reference as of 12/7 Market Open:

* SPY 370 Calls: $2.10
* TESLA 600 Calls: $2500",2020-12-07 20:56:58

Everyone and their wife’s boyfriend want CRISPR technology to be successful.  These have been running riot in the last few months, but they still have a long way to go.  CRSP, EDIT, NTLA are already old news.  Sure, you can cure beta-Thalassemia, and Sickle Cell Disease, easy-peasy.  The problem is that the double stranded breaks that CRISPR uses are super bad for you.  Google that shit.  That has been one of the ways scientists studying aging have prematurely aged mice in the lab.

Enter BEAM Therapeutics.  BEAM uses the same CRISPR concept to locate a specific spot in your DNA, but doesn’t require breaking the DNA strands at all.  They use a strategy called Base Editing, where the CRISPR protein finds the DNA that you want, and then they edit the single nucleotide by changing it into a different nucleotide.  It’s genius.  On top of that, they have the next, next technology: Prime Editing.  This makes a little nick in the DNA and also doesn’t require a double stranded break.

BEAM has a market cap of somewhere between $3 to $4 billion depending on the day.  They have enough funding secured for a 1-year runway.  There are recent successes with boomer CRISPR (looking at you CRSP) that will cause tons of money to flow into the gene editing field.  All of those companies have ultra-small market caps compared to the value they add to society.  I’m long the whole field, but because of the double stranded break issue, I have to believe Base Editing and Prime Editing are the future.

There has been a race in the EV space. Per the article, the current assessment is that Tesla is in the lead. A company with a shot at getting the second spot would be VW. If anyone is interested in finding out more about about VW's approach, it is helpful to read up on their actual approach (through Herbert Diess). His vision is to transform the company into a digital company which operates millions of mobility devices: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-transform-volkswagen-herbert-diess/

This is important as it highlights the similarity with Tesla's approach to how the cars are conceived, built and updated. VW has a project named ""Mission T"" so this is no surprise. Approaching the car like a software product where the data plays a critical role. The product is used to collect data and feed it back to the manufacturer, so the relationship with the customer is not over once the sale is complete. The collected information is used to continuously enhance the product and create software updates and even new features (autonomous driving, etc.)

A company in the EV space using a more traditional approach will have hard time catching up as the the market leader will always be moving at an exponential rate.

What we are seeing is a prime example of the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" and how many new technologies are being brought together in designing and launching new products (not just cars).",2020-12-07 19:31:11

They are the #1 kitchen accessory company in the whole damn world. Ride or Die.

The are the sole licensed brand for Instant Pot Accessories, and sell knives for the highest sold knife brand, Farberware.

Management is working towards a goal of $90M+ EBITA which makes this one a steal at is current market cap.

This trade will not fizzle out... once people start learning how to cook. they will cook more. People will continue to stock up on all the Kitchen essentials as they learn how to cook and even some may consider it a hobby.

They make a 3D printer that makes small metal parts that were once thought to be difficult and expensive to make. Now through a complicated process I don't understand well enough to explain, it can be printed saving time and money. The process is explained in way more detail on their [website.](https://www.desktopmetal.com/)

They have a variety of different products, including a range in systems from smaller scale production designed for engineers building prototypes, to a larger scale printer for mass production. The metals they print include Copper, two different grades of stainless steel and three other metals I don't know anything about. Again more details on their [website.](https://www.desktopmetal.com/materials)

Customers listed on their website include 3M, Medtronic, Toyota, BMW, and even the US military. Basically any company that produces anything with small metal parts could in theory become a customer making the growth potential astronomical. The industry as a whole is expected to grow from a total of $12 Billion today, to $150 Billion by the end of 2030.

The key difference between this company and it's competitors is something called ""single jet passing."" Through this process, the system can produce everything faster than any other system currently available.

There are however draw backs to the company. They are relatively new, and therefor need to expand to reach their full potential. The industry as a whole also takes time to change, and growth for the company will progress as slowly as their market changes. As a result DM's aggressive targets for growth seem difficult to attain. Essentially, patience will be key as most of their current and immediate value will be dependent on the hype they generate.

The stock is up 75% in the past few weeks, so it's really no secret. The buy low opportunity has come and gone. But the long term payday here is immense. It's being regarded as a potential 10 bagger based off of industry trends.

Net revenue for the third quarter increased to $280,000 from $92,000 in the prior quarter and from $56,000 in Q3 of last year. The sequential and year-over-year increase in net revenue was due to a significant amount of revenue generated from two customers in the quarter.

You read that right, they were making cash off of *the AI's beta test* - it is now in the wild and finding botnets.

Did I mention the company's market cap is under $50 million as of writing this? They just unleashed an AI that is about to slap everyone cheating on adsense, *this is about to make waves.*

DD,LMPX - high-growth disruptor in the automotive industry.,6,k8i0tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8i0tg/lmpx_highgrowth_disruptor_in_the_automotive/,10,1607381677.0,"LMPX - an opportunity to 3-4x your investment within a year.

Briefly about the company: LMP Automotive is an online auto dealership which is positioning itself to be a disruptor through its subscription model and online platform.

&#x200B;

**Let's look at what happened to the firm recently:**

\- COVID-19 boosted LMPX's online sales and turbocharged the industry's transition to the online channel, subscription models and ride-sharing.

\- LMPX grew topline revenue by 240% in the 9 months of FY2020. I am projecting revenues to triple for the full year 2020 and at least double in FY2021. I will briefly talk about the valuation later.

\- Management announced a major acquisition and substantial investment in new auto inventory as well as new facilities to expand its business. After analyzing management commentaries, it is evident that there is a supply constraint which prevented revenues from increasing much more than 240%. Expansion plans will allow LMPX to grow revenues rapidly going into 2021 and 2022.

\- LMPX announced partnerships which shows that suppliers are eager to partner with LMPX and see the firm's growth potential and a promising business model.

&#x200B;

**Upcoming catalysts in the next 6-9 months:**

Disclosures in company reports as well as commentary from the CEO indicate LMPX stock can get a substantial boost from the following upcoming catalysts:

\- Successful closing of financing agreements with banks and closing of the ongoing acquisition.

\- Significant expansion of its online platform with approx. 10,000 autos being planned to be placed on the platform.

Quoting the CEO: ""we are one of the top 3 online-centric automotive companies in the country, but better than that, we're all about performance, we're all about execution. We believe that will drive sales to levels that it will be harder to fulfill than actually having the leads and lead conversions given the test markets and given the competition. That I believe will be the largest catalyst, when we put it all online.""

Also, insiders own around 40% of the outstanding shares and are aligned with investors. Recently, insiders have been accumulating more shares in the 10-20 dollar price range and the CEO mentioned in an interview that he believes the stock significantly undervalues the company's near-term fundamentals which is the reason for such high insider ownership. What this all means is that 2021 can be a blockbuster year for LMPX and its stock.

&#x200B;

**Market opportunity / TAM:**

\- Subscription based vehicle sales are estimated to account for 10% of all vehicle sales by 2025, which translates into a $100 billion opportunity by 2025. LMPX is one of the first movers and is expected to capture a large portion of this growing market.

\- The fact that LMPX revenues are up so much when the rest of the auto industry is down due to the pandemic indicates that LMPX is a disruptor and could see revenues multiply very soon.

&#x200B;

**Valuation and price target:**

\- LMPX delivered revenues of approx. $26million in the 9 months of FY2020. I estimate full year 2020 revenues to come in at about $33 million which equates to a 200% increase over FY2019.

\- With the stock trading at $27 and with 10 million shares outstanding, LMPX has a market cap of $270 million. On a price to FY2020 sales basis, the stock has a P/S multiple of 8x. This is a very low multiple considering multiples the market is giving to other growth companies and considering that LMPX tripled revenues in 2020 and is expected to grow them considerably going into 2021-2022.

\- I expect revenues to at least double in 2021 and the stock to peak at a 15x P/Sales multiple. This implies a price target of $100 by year end 2021. Having said that, I aim to take profits in 90-100$ price range.

&#x200B;

Positions/disclosure:

I am long 150 shares bought in at an average price of $27.5 and I am looking to add to the position once the price starts to indicate more upward momentum.

&#x200B;

**TLDR - Long LMPX, current price $27, YE 2021 price target at $100.**

DD,Boomer Stock Recovery Play: Coca-Cola,75,k8ht7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8ht7i/boomer_stock_recovery_play_cocacola/,31,1607380954.0,"**TLDR; Coca Cola is still 10% below its pre-covid high.  It should go even higher.**

For the 8 of you still reading, I present to you a somewhat neglected stock hurt by Covid that hasn't fully recovered, but also one whose February high of $60 is not a ceiling.

Yes, Coca Cola has had a decent run from it's $36 March lows and is even up 12% since October, trading about $54/share as of Friday before pulling back a bit this morning.  It's not done yet.  Let me provide a few reasons why.

To understand where we're going, let's look at where we've been. Here's a 5 year chart.

&#x200B;

[5 year performance of KO: courtesy of CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/4lmb773xnl361.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e426700a92d40cd64e6d58994cb5f330a9b8658)

The stock has been of a bit of a snoozer until it began to awake from its slumber about 2018, which accelerated through 2019 and then Wall Street really started to like it in 2020.  It had upward momentum, upset by Covid.  This momentum will return, very soon.

**Catalyst:  In Person Dining**

Why will momentum return?  Most importantly, vaccines will return restaurants back to normal operations by summer 2021. The restaurant industry has been in total carnage.  Independent restaurants are closing permanently every day, with large chains taking market share.  BUT - those that are still operating are living off of Off-Premise consumption.  IF people get drinks to go, they get one.  No refills.  This has depressed an entire major sector of Coke's sales.  As restaurants return to normal, they'll have more customers, and existing customers will be consuming more cokes per sale than they are now.  That's a double re-open win.

**Catalyst: Cutting overhead like a mo-fo**

There's more to this story.  Coke has used Covid as an opportunity to cut costs and streamline operations.  They've cut employees and overhead expense - [more than 1/3 of their North American employees](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/28/coca-cola-says-layoffs-buyouts-likely-part-restructuring/5654218002/).  They've cut a lot of niche product that had overhead burden and marketing/distribution expense but had little revenue, much less profit, [like Tab.](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/10/19/Coca-Cola-discontinues-TaB-diet-soda-in-the-US)

They're going to come out of this a leaner, more focused company.  They may still have an old and sleepy brand image, but they're also a cash printing machine, and they're going to be printing even more tendies to share with us.

**Catalyst: Falling Dollar**

But wait! There's more!

Coca Cola generates [roughly one third of its revenue from North America](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271136/coca-colas-revenue-distribution-worldwide-by-operating-segment/).  That leaves the balance subject to currency fluctuations.  With the dollar tanking, [those foreign profits are going to be worth even more.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/how-us-benefits-when-dollar-falls.asp)

**Not Priced In**

Looking at the [CNBC.com](https://CNBC.com) earnings helps demonstrate that the street has not priced in the recovery, much less the benefits from restructuring and currency.  The company itself has not been providing guidance as they have no more visibility than we do how the almost random shutdown/reopen orders will happen.  They did, however, [warn that Q3 would be hampered by currency exchange rates when the dollar was strengthening](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coca-cola-stock-is-rising-after-earnings-heres-why-51595335348), the opposite of what is happening now and projected to continue for a bit.  How did Q3 end up when the currency was facing headwinds?  They beat the street consensus by 18.8%, and were just one cent per share less than a year ago - when unemployment was at a record low and everything was ""normal"".

&#x200B;

[Coke's Earnings Trend - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/34xwla91jm361.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=15d64af9e6559ac5d1bb1e8bf1cc76f77e8f219b)

Based on the same CNBC data, the street is projecting that one year from now, after restaurants are fully operational, after the company has completed a worldwide restructuring that will eliminate 1/3 of its North American employees, and after the benefit of a presumed lower dollar, the company will just be earning 3 cents more in Q3 and Q4 2021 than it did in 2019, pre-covid.  Again, this would say that reopening their fountain sales division to normal levels is only worth 4 cents per share from this past quarter when much of the country remains shut down.  That seems low.  Too low.

**Benchmark: Starbucks**

What's the upside here?  I'm using Starbucks as the benchmark.  They're both beverage companies, though Starbucks is clearly more of a direct restaurant play, and more of a pure play on China's reopening - which is far ahead of the US's and the rest of the world's economy.

&#x200B;

[Starbucks One Year Performance - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/ifebi0x2tl361.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=606fe19138dfcfc86ff139b105225bc1b2dab23b)

Starbucks hit a high of about 93 in January, as Covid was already gripping China.  It then fell and rebounded to about $90 in February before beginning the March market swoon.  On the way back up it kept bouncing into that $90 level (frustrating the hell out of me holding $90 calls) before finally breaking through on the way to all time highs, now at $102, almost 10% above the January highs.

Looking at a similar pattern (though KO held on longer before a much quicker descent) I would expect KO to test $60 soon, and probably bounce off a time or two before breaking through.  Again, based on prior momentum I would expect once it clears $60 it should easily run up another 10%.  The market will quickly recognize when they reopen they're going to have more operating leverage than when the shutdown began, and they're going to start seeing currency gains as soon as this quarter.

**Benchmark: Pepsi**

Pepsi is probably viewed as Coke's more direct competitor.  Coke had been outperforming them over the last 3 years until the Covid dip.  Pepsi, more diversified because of its snack businesses, was the better stay at home play.  Coke has a decent catch up trade remaining.

[3 year performance Coke vs Pepsi: Barchart.com](https://preview.redd.it/x6eb2dahfm361.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d74d592426a18cfc7be54f10f760bc19dd8fd53)

**Strategy:**

Sugar water doesn't get stock analysts excited any more than WSB casino patrons.  For that reason, I would not be looking at any FD's.  This one needs some longer dated options.

I want to get past the next earnings on 1/28 for evidence of the currency lift to begin to show, but the country will likely still be in winter Covid shutdown mode so I'm not sure we'll get guidance then based on restaurant openings.  I'm also feeling like mid-January/February could be a bit rough after a lights-out November and a presumed Santa Claus rally at month's end.  Keep some powder dry to buy this on dips. I am.

I'm thinking there's a three-prong approach here.

For the first taste, February 55 calls.  Relatively low risk (only slightly OTM), gets us a few weeks past the next earnings date when we should at least see a currency boost, but also captures any run up as the market starts to figure out there's still reopening meat left here to take off the bone.

I'm going to put the heart of the play into June 60 calls.  The country should be mostly vaccinated, restaurants should be back to near normal.  Hopefully this will be telegraphed by the April earnings call.  If this gets priced in sooner...[Vega is your friend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7eto7/you_trolls_are_in_desperate_need_of_understanding/)

For a stretch, going to throw the balance of the play into leaps for Jan 2022 65's.

I'm starting this position with $5K.  Because I expect a decent dip sometime Jan/Feb, will hopefully have some dry powder on the sideline to increase these positions if I've been too early on this move.  But as we've seen with many of the reopening plays, when the market decides it's time, I don't want to be late....or any later than I already am.

That would put current value of SPX at 2618$-3015$ in 2019 dollars.

So if true, we are technically not at the ATH.

It would also mean, to reach same ""value"" of its (3380$) top from last January it would need to go to:

4121$-4760$

1. Some of you may know the initial life cycle of a stock after its IPO

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4ezmfwt9q361.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e2bccafaf7b8be65602664bcfda034b5d121f55

I sat down this morning with a cup of coffee and briefly looked at NIO and Palantir stocks

And It is not always the case but something much more thought requiring and complicated

2) Basically, NIO and Palantir look like 2 distant realities

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c4vswn8b9q361.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d125665ae074fa251ecacf5bc455e188b39ed3e9

It did not go immediately into the main hype and It took 2 years to do so. Of course, before the end of May 2020 NIO was just a Chinese tech company with little awareness in America, being IPOed in the US, It explains such a time

But the more (time), the merrier (volatility), and the little awareness about NIO and how things are going in the company created a highly inefficient market. The stock rose from its low of about 1.20$ to 57.20$ (47.66 times of 4666%). It is a tech company, and Who doesn't love the juicy tech?

Also, there've been 2 small hypes before the main hype (as opposed to the graph above with its 1 small hype rise and the main hype rise)

(The diagonal blue line is the mean that is drawn based on the lows and highs on the graph above, the curve is the 200 EMA)

3) But Palantir is another story

&#x200B;

It started trading on 30 Sep. 2020, and It took just 1 month to start the main hype. There was no initial hype (well the kind of a rise that you can consider to be substantial, Before 30 October It just got up and down by approx. a 1 $, relative to the price before the rise of approx. 10 $)

There is a nice dip on 30 Oct and after that, there's a shallow but continuous rise before there's the dramatic rise in the price (the tendency that you can also see in NIO)

These two stocks crashed (Well, They actually just went down not substantially) right after they IPOed.

The market basically wanted to get to the dip and to trigger some selling activity just so the smartest traders can get more shares for cheap

There are 3 great dips on the trend of the main hype, in an upward channel manner in both NIO and Palantir. NIO has longer and shallower dips indicating the uncertainty and the lack of Information behind the stock. Palantir had dips ranging from a couple of hours to 2 days

The two dips before the main hype are below the mean (Which can be drawn initially before the main hype, using the low at the very beginning, further lows and highs and their support resistance channel levels, and the general upside direction, Just like in the pictures above).

This quick analysis takes the time period between when Stock IPOed and the top of the main hype.  The analysis doesn't look at what happens next after the stock reaches its hype top.

The coffee was good and the morning was nice and I hope that you can build a good strategy on the initial life cycle and behavior patterns of hype stocks.......

While revenue grew 53% y/y, losses grew 213%. y/y. I.e. money is burning faster than they can make it. Even after taking out stock based compensation and looking purely at operating expenses, they lose $141M a quarter. Yet unity is mature company, almost 20 years old. It’s not in the R&D phase/early growth. It already has a >50% share of the mobile and VR gaming markets. Wtf? So they are spending like crazy to try to grow? They actually can afford to. They have zero debt and 1.7B (billion!) in cash, thanks to going public. That cash represents plenty of runway. Yet even in their first quarterly report, they do indicate they continue to grow by acquisition and might issue more shares to fuel that growth.

I’ve been actually been meaning to buy into this stock based on memeness / buy any COVID stock and after today feeling some fomo. But it’s run up over 300% in just three months and now I’m feeling bearish on it. Any thoughts?",2020-12-09 07:44:36
Discussion,Michel Burry Short On TSLA,41,k9l3lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9l3lm/michel_burry_short_on_tsla/,107,1607517483.0,"***Michel Burry Short Position***

On **$TSLA**

As we all already know the news on shorting TSLA by Michel Burry came out Dec 3, 2020

From his standpoint on the position, the argument is that the price of TSLA is overvalued and there should be a correction made in the market. The profitability of TSLA and the rate of expected profitability is high but however, they are not on the rate of profitability for their projected Q1-Q2.

He showed on his tweet about the trade; The total Revenue, Market Capitalization, and EBIT of 32 companies in the auto sector and compared them to TSLA. It shows us that TSLA is underperforming and is in fact overvalued.

I will now go in-depth of my review of TSLA and break the companies performance using multiple financial benchmarks.

In this review I will use companies in the auto sector, TSLA’s direct competition and EV ETF’s I will, however, account for the future probability of the company since I think that it has high importance.

Bellow are key benchmarks shown: ( total Revenue, Market Cap, And Ebit)

https://preview.redd.it/2xd9g29de3461.jpg?width=1815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80a05b1a18c5d96795caa2cc5ffdac0e57e405f4

&#x200B;

In this spreadsheet, we can see the comparison between the total  (Revenue/Market Cap/Ebit) of the whole auto sector. and in compression to TSLA.  From this, we can determine that tesla in Market Cap alone beats all other Auto manufacturers.  Their EBIT this year is about 1.7 Billion to the 40 Billion total. But does the company truly have the potential and the value that it is at?

***Bellow, I will add more benchmarks to TSLA compared to the industry to see the true value in the company and its financials and external sources of value to TSLA that would make this trade go in the wrong direction.***

https://preview.redd.it/8v48shyje3461.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a1038c71293b90ca474810c614651038aec6e30

&#x200B;

If we look purply at the (share price) we clearly see the massive 867% yearly gain on TSLA. However, if we look at the metrics where the company excelled in would be P/E, Price/Book.

Where the problem is would be the profit margins. Both EPS and EBIT metrics are low for the value of the company.  That is the main problem of the overvaluation of TSLA is that they don't make enough profit to validate their share price. We can say that the future value is there however in the short term the price is moving in a way that would indicate to us a bubble. And a correction that should affect the price of the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/8bdwsdmle3461.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1e57b3f2277c41f216b8e29a3d46aff1a4ce1b0

&#x200B;

Here I demonstrate mixed metrics on all the 32 companies in the auto sector. To show how TSLA is underperforming in most of the benchmarks. This is to show where the company has overvalued and how.

* MKT cap ($616b)
* Accounts payable turnover:  ( The accounts payable turnover ratio is a short term measure used to quantify the rate at which a company pays off its suppliers. Accounts payable turnover shows how many times a company pays off its accounts payable during a period.)       -Here TSLA has a rate of 5.43 that states to us; they are taking time to pay to their creditors and compared to other companies in the auto sector are underperforming in this benchmark.
* Profit Margin: -2.56% of the cost of production exceeds total sales. TSLA has more costs than they are able to cover by their profit. Other companies that have a negative profit margin in the sector all have a share price lower than their valuation.
* Gross profit: $4.07B where the value is $616B this indicator alone shows us that the company is way overvalued. We can argue that they are in the Tech sector more than in manufacture or cars. But however, their model of operations demonstrate to us that they are heavily weighted on that side of the business and not tech.
* Supply chain revenue: 0.19% this benchmark demonstrates that they are not generating enough revenue from their supply chain operations.
* Inventory days: ( how many days on average does it take to take 'product to market') 59.3 days Higher than the average of the auto sector.
* Inventory growth: 14.09 in the past 12M
* ROA: -1.96% losing money on their return on assets.

&#x200B;

The average target price of TSLA is **$375** however there are indeed more buy signals at 35.9%

But Burry's target price would be around $300-$350

&#x200B;

Verdict:  Based on the financials it is overvalued

&#x200B;

The level of puts on open interest is increasing in the market this would indicate that Bearish volumes in the market on TSLA

&#x200B;

Q1 of 2021 shows us the options volumes where the market is pumping more volume in the lower level of the stock price.

I strongly agree with the numbers and that this stock is overvalued but has a lot of extrinsic potential and value in the future, but there should be a market correction that would take place and we can profit from this move. TSLA is a great company and has a bright history but at the levels, it is at now. I personally do not see it going higher. And this would be my break around of Michel Burry's short trade on TSLA.",2020-12-09 07:38:03

DD,[DD] GME shareholder DD and support thread,95,k9klph,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9klph/dd_gme_shareholder_dd_and_support_thread/,61,1607515645.0,"This is for shareholders only, if you bought calls expiring before late Jan you probably can't read since almost every DD before this told you to buy shares or LEAPs.

So anyway after GME management has shown themselves to be as retarded as we are, I thought I'd share a few things for the newbies to help cope and recoup losses after today's shit show. if you read my previous post you would've expected a dump after Q3 earnings, although I have to admit I was expecting a 10% dump, not a 17% dump. That shelf offering was completely unexpected and the only valid reason for having it IMO would be for management to sell some shares during a squeeze to help raise funds. There are a few other reasons that people brought up that I thought made sense, no need for me to repeat it here. 

Fundamentally the earnings were pretty much as expected, a better than expected loss was pretty much priced in and things look like they're on track for Q4. Management closed more unprofitable stores, reduced inventory, sold their private jet (lol), and e-commerce is up. Risks to that outlook would be a restart of lockdowns and stimulus not being passed on time. Remember that IWM and many other ETFs hold quite a lot of GME shares, so a dump in those means we dumping as well. Don't forget to think about the risk of an overall market dump, since we are getting close to dec OPEX with record low put/call ratios, this market is being driven up by call buying and MM hedging can dump just as hard as they pump. I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that'll take place between late dec- early Feb, watch for changes in option positioning and VIX term structure for clues.

Between now and Q4, the only catalyst for a durable pump would be the announcement of deals like the one with MSFT (there are rumors of a deal with SONY, not likely IMO), reports of VERY strong sales of consoles (good isn't good enough). We will likely start to have a slow ramp-up leading up to the earnings. These are your reasons to bag hold. 

People keep on asking RC to start a takeover but I doubt that will happen, in fact, I think RC might just sell his stake, since it's already up like 300%. Don't make any significant moves based on speculations on what RC might do.

For the immediate near term, figure out how to sell covered calls if you haven't already, selling weeklies can help bring down your cost basis, especially while IV is high. iBorrow shows borrow costs at 50%, which is near ATH I think, we might get a small but significant short-covering rally, sell your calls into these rallies. On the other hand, WSB might FOMO into weekly puts, which will also inevitably backfire but drag prices down in the process, take advantage of this by finding put walls near support and selling puts at a price you're comfortable DCA-ing at. 

Keep your eyes on the prize, which IMO really just come down to a new console cycle, the fact that there is a shortage of consoles right now just means people will be forced to shop at GME when other giants like AMZN or WMT runs out of stock. Keep an eye on any news about logistics and supply chain, if the giants get the upper hand in procuring new consoles, that will seriously damage the bull thesis

Long GME

Also someone please explain to me how diluting makes it harder for Cohen to take over coz I just saw GME say they were diluting by 10% but they knocked 17% off of their market cap. Doesn't that make it easier for Cohen to take whatever controlling stake since now the market cap is cheaper and isn't a controlling stake like 50% of the company or something I don't get it. I really think this at the shelf offering is preparation to take advantage of a short squeeze

On the one hand it caps how high the short squeeze is gonna go

On the other hand it incentivizes GME's management to get the party started since GME's balance sheet is about to get even better if they trigger one soon with an onslaught of good news.",2020-12-09 06:54:34

The numbers behind on mortgage/rent come from [This Census Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp19.html#tables). The unpaid rent/mortgage number comes from [a Philly Fed Study](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/community-development/reports/household-rental-debt-during-covid-19.pdf) estimate that the average household behind will owe ~$5,800 and multiplying it by the census numbers for behind on rent/mortgage. The real numbers may be as low 1/3 that of my estimate, but $100 billion makes for a good title. The census numbers lag a few weeks (Nov 11-23) so there also the possibility that I have slightly underestimated. 

Looking at the numbers a different way, in terms of the numbers of people eligible for eviction/foreclosure come Jan 1 when the national moratorium is lifted, the Nov 11-23 numbers represent a 45+ day delinquency. We get close to 70 million people using the raw household numbers from the census data, multiplied by the household size. One mitigating factor here is that some lenders are choosing to tack on owed mortgage payments to end the of the loan instead of seeking immediate repayment. Assuming half of the ~~30 million~~ 8 million delinquent mortgages are given the option to defer payments to the end of the loan the total numbers fall to ~55 million people or roughly 1/6 of the US population. The other mitigating factor is the patchwork of local and state eviction moratoriums in many of the large cities and populous costal states, which account for roughly 2/3rds of the population. This result is better but still grim, between 15-20 million up for eviction, concentrated in areas without eviction moratoriums where the eviction rate will be roughly 1 in 6. Many forced from their homes will never make a significant contribution to the economy ever again, those that do it will be years before they get back on their feet.

Another metric to look at is the value of the housing that the tens of billions in missed rent/mortgage payments represent. Doing quick and dirty math of 300k median housing price times 17 million households gives the astonishing $5.1 trillion in toxic residential assets. Using 2/3rds to account for the lower per unit cost of apartments and condos that's still $3.5 trillion and who knows what multiple of that number is tied up in MBSs and derivatives dependent on those loans. This also doesn't account for the lost value as millions of vacant houses and apartments start flooding every market without an eviction moratorium. 

note: I'm not expecting a new Stimulus bill before the 116th congress adjourns, so I'm not considering its effects. Both sides keep drawing lines in the sand the other wont cross, and have been for 7 months. Or put another way, we ain't getting shit with DOW@30k. Even if the eviction moratorium gets extended all we're doing is driving further up the mountain before driving off the cliff. 

TL;DR: Tens of Billions of missed payments, trillions in toxic assets, millions becoming homeless starting Jan 1, millions of evections starting Jan 1, a flood of vacant units destroying rental and property prices, cats and dogs living together, it's September 1929, only all the speakeasies are closed. 

Oh yeah, I haven't even considered commercial properties.

I don't have a position yet, but I think even with this announcement I'll scale into a position regardless with some options. Even at $100m offering, that is a dilution of less than 10 million shares. I believe the numbers were something like 60+ million shares held short in the middle of November. I'm sure that the number has decreased but I doubt that the short float has dropped to below 10 million shares. I'm pretty sure shorts are looking for a way out of this squeeze, and maybe this is their saving grace, I'll start grabbing a position later this week with some long term options.

As some of you may or may not know IBM is splitting into 2 companies next year. IBM has also experienced significant layoffs in the US and will do so in Europe. This is unfortunately not great news for the employees who were hit by the layoffs, but it is a good sign for investors.

IBM has become WAY too big (300,000 employees), and WAY to diverse. It will be splitting into a Consulting business and IBM will stay as a tech company. This means that next year IBM will be a lighter ship which will be easier to maneuver, innovate, and deliver. Im in it for a long haul. What are your thoughts?

What this means is that the shares are supposed to be owned by market open on 12/21... which means most shares should be purchased by close of market on 12/18. However, funds have +/- 3 days to make the purchase, so 12/23 (and maybe 24th) is also perfectly valid for them to buy on.  Then there is the fact that, in the face of a big runup, they may opt to just miss their tracking marker for a few days while hoping for a 'sale' on TSLA.

Historically most funds purchase in the 24-48 hours leading up to inclusion date, although TSLA is anything but business as usual.

If you are trying to time a buy (or sell), the drop may not be until 12/28 or later.  It's possible we even get a squeeze AFTER 12/28 as funds look around and realize the price is still rising.

The .8% of float being issued today into a 30% of float forced-buy did almost nothing to relieve buying pressure.

DD,ZUO primed for LT growth,7,k9cqa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9cqa1/zuo_primed_for_lt_growth/,19,1607489438.0,"**TL; DR:** ZUO is rapidly approaching profitability in a tough year, and the Stripe Partnership might give them the boost they need to really take off in 2021.

I hold short term calls and several shares of Zuo.

**General Thesis**
Zuora is a SaaS company providing billing, payment, collection, and data analysis tools for companies that use subscription payments for revenue.  The main drivers for its revenue are the number of users and the amount of usage.  Anyone that pays attention, knows that the number of subscription companies is going up and up.  It is a proven model that many companies enjoy.  Thus, Zuora is aiming to provide the software tools to help those companies best leverage the model.

**Numbers**
Even during the pandemic, where cost cutting pressures have inspired many to cut their subscriptions, Zuora was able to obtain 11% YoY growth in number of key customers and 31% increase in customer usage YoY.  Since 2017, the gross profit has steadily increased about 35% each year and looks to maintain that pace in 2020.

The stock price dropped from 2018 until more recently because of high net losses in 2019 (substantial increased operating expenses due to being a publicly-traded company) and the black swan event that was the pandemic.  Further, the revenue didn't increase as much in 2019 (17.5%) as it did in 2018 (49%), and this year it only appears to be increasing by 8%.

However, the operating expenses (R&D, marketing, etc.) are increasing at a slower rate than the gross profit in 2020, which is reflected in the decreasing net losses reported in the past 3 out of 4 quarters.  It is worth mentioning that they beat analyst expectations in all of those 4 reported quarters and the trend line is toward net profits.  They project a net loss of $14mn with a revenue over $300mn for 2020.  Even though the revenue increase is fairly disappointing, the decreasing net losses is pretty encouraging when obtained in a year like 2020.  With Zuora being on the verge of profitability, increases in customer numbers and therefore revenue could result in profit for the year 2021.  Cue Stripe.

**Stripe Partnership**
Many of Stripe's customers use the subscription model.  And Stripe has a lot of customers with famous brands that could be key customers of Zuora.  As reported on MarketWatch, the partnership will allow Zuora customers to use the payment processing and fraud detection technology of Stripe. In the announcement, the CEO of Zuora mentioned that companies with recurring-revenue models (subscriptions) have a lower chance of fraud, so they should be able to attract better payment-processing rates from Stripe.  To me, if Zuora is able to provide its customers better payment-processing rates via its partnership with Stripe, then this provides an incentive for relevant Stripe customers to also use Zuora.  From a customer perspective, the decrease in payment-processing rates paid to Stripe while using Zuora could subsidize the subscription cost of Zuora, and the tools of Zuora could help increase revenue for said customer.  The partnership could be a catalyst for Zuora customer growth/revenue and therefore push Zuora into profitability.

**Industry PE Ratio**
Zuora's current market cap is $1.4bn on a projected revenue of about $300mn for this year and $14mn in losses.  With PE ratios so high these days, especially with software companies, I think any indication of profitability from Zuora could send the stock price flying.

**Conclusion**
Thus, I am bullish long term with Zuora, and because the market is forward looking, I think people will try to jump in early.  This could cause the stock price to bounce fairly quickly in the short term, too.  Last I checked, the current days to cover for shorts is 4 days.",2020-12-08 23:50:38

Sounds ridiculously overpriced? Yeah, I agree, I won't personally be buying them. But AirPods, which ~~I also think are stupid~~  are highly intelligent products, made Apple roughly $12 billion in 2019, and likely more in 2020. I think these AirPod headphones are going to be even bigger. They are also introducing Apple Fitness, which will help them access the coveted $BECKY market. Do your own DD but I'm feeling pretty confident in it, especially with the kind of stonks people are currently memeing into absurd valuations, here is company actually worth the valuation.

Edit: fixed the post for all of you Tim Apple fanboys. This wasn't supposed to be about whether AirPods are a waste of money or not because I really don't care. If anything, the fact that people are arguing with me and telling me how good they are in spite of my counterarguments makes me that much more confident in my calls.

We know VIX is the volatility indicator and we know the more volatile the stock is the more premium we get. So if VIX gets super low, then would we get less premium for the same stock (or same beta stock)? So to earn high juicy premiums (theta gang stuff) we need high volatile markets with volatile stocks? Trying to put two and two together :/

The second part of my question is related to IV crush! So how does beta (standard deviation), relate to IV crush?

Raven industries is a budding tech company that has stretched its little paws into nearly every memeable sector. How this hasn’t been talked about around here **(at all)** is beyond me. 

They’ve got the **A.A.S** trifecta of meme as a part of their core business plan.  

**Autonomous Vehicles**: Preorders for their new “AutoCart” line of autonomous agricultural vehicles just opened on December 2nd. 

**Aerospace**: Their “Aerostar” branch saw record numbers for customer flight campaigns. Basically, they send balloons into space for wifi or surveillance or some shit idk. They also use these balloons to monitor atmospheric conditions and make satellite missions.

This means, to be counted as a postive in the results, you must be symptomatic AND have a positive test

>Among 3410 total cases of suspected but unconfirmed COVID-19 in the overall study population, 1594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1816 in the placebo group.

Here, we can see that they didn't test 3000 suspected cases. They would not be suspected cases if they were tested, by definition. Clearly this is a big deal as the placebo group shows many more infections

>Phase 3 breakdown, sourced from top Candian biostatician, department head: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmezgmAXMAMCDBT?format=jpg&name=large

Here we can see the lack of testing. Of 40,000 participants, assuming all were a placebo, would yield ~200 infections.

200/40,000 yields a SARS2 prevelance across the 40k sample size of 0.5%. Clearly, world odometer data shows a much higher amount of infection.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

15,000,000 / 330,000,000 = 4.5%

Hey everyone ! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/zn9tpLg) down by half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4M2n7J) down 0,2% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/wKwCKwg) outperformed, finishing up 0,45 and closing yet again at a new record high. We did see the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/MNPsRvH) going higher, as more uncertainty puts some pressure on the markets with the stimulus and government funding bill on the [table](https://ibb.co/wzM6bt0).

We saw a bigger [ratio](https://ibb.co/TWQQdcx) of companies losing ground yesterday as small caps and especially growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/DVpQVkH) with gains being made only in Technology, Utilities and Communications [sectors](https://ibb.co/BrbBWSV) while Energy was the biggest loser as the illness still keeps the pressure on the Oil business.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/fDSSmKp) from yesterday as 3 of the big FAANG names outperformed the market yesterday, with Apple being up more than 1% while FB and NFLX did even better up 2 and 3,5% for the day. You can also see a lot of red in this map as not many companies did good yesterday except big tech names.

So, some TESLA [news](https://ibb.co/QpNsY6H), yesterday the company spiked to a new all time high at over 640$ as the stock soared over 7% again. The stock has gone up more than 200$ in the last [month](https://ibb.co/xJp0QmJ) as more and more people are buying shares in anticipation of the SP500 inclusion and more and more analysts raise price target and expectations for the company. Tesla also just [announced](https://ibb.co/CJLCnW9) a sell of shares worth of $5B again as the company continues to raise more capital to fund the new factories and firm up the balance sheet while reducing the debt of the company. I think this a good time to be careful and maybe take some profits in this stock before next week, as many people may end up selling shares on the 18th and 21st and we might see a correction instead of a spike in price when the company is included in the SP500. aka \[buy the news/sell the event\] [NEWS](https://ibb.co/1ZLmb8w)

Some of the economic data that we received yesterday was worse than expected as the home purchase sentiment [index](https://ibb.co/fYW7jYD) rising streak ended this month with a dip of 1.7 points and is down more than 11 points year over year.

While the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement is [index](https://ibb.co/N1mkxK7) down from the previous month as investors bought more Apple, Tesla and AT&T shares while selling Moderna, Beyond Meat and Micron.

Also, the small business optimism [index](https://ibb.co/FVg3827) dipped more than expected and fell to 101,2, down from 104 in October.

So, a recent survey from Investopedia [shows](https://ibb.co/hFcyKCM) that over 20% of investors are expecting gains of at least 10% for next year with more than ¾ expecting that 2021 will be another positive year for the stock market.

Most investors [expect](https://ibb.co/1sRKWyt) the biggest gains to be made in the US equities while CHINA and other emerging markets are the next to follow with the Eurozone expected to lag.

While this individual investors [expect](https://ibb.co/dj9LbN9) the large cap tech companies to continue to have big gains followed by pharma and health companies. I think this is a recency bias, as I don’t think any one sector will largely outperform next year, with lots of gains to be made everywhere once the full reopening of the economy will begin. [Jim Cramer Quote](https://ibb.co/pL2v0bm)

I think investors are pretty bullish as the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/wBhx0Fb) showed last week, I think this might be a problem for the stock market. I don’t think the stock market will go up as fast as investors would like, and this might push more of them into more and more risk taking, especially the new investors, which desire to make a fortune fast. I expect the stock market to be higher by this time next year, but the rate of which it will go up is still going to scare some investors off. As the market sentiment is way into euphoria [levels](https://ibb.co/rvzbx3R) as you can see in this survey, and with retail investors being more powerful than ever before as they account for about 20% of the stock market activity on average daily as we also might see some turbulence in the next couple of months until things will become more stable with the economy, vaccines, politics and everything else with the smart money [index](https://ibb.co/P6VJTQ0) continues to drop while stocks reach new highs, this might be the time to take a wait and see approach and maybe try to buy the dips when they come.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/Q6WXNtp) came early today the first ever recipient of the public vaccine from Pfizer has been vaccinated today in the UK, this is the start of the rollout of the vaccine in the UK and it is expected that the US will follow in the next couple of weeks. As the “vaccine summit” will be in full [display](https://ibb.co/t3zYjJ6) this week. This is great news for the entire world.

On some individual stock news, the darling of the moment Lemonade just [launched](https://ibb.co/F8FLjgF) in its 3rd EU country, in France, following the Netherlands and Germany launches.

While the 2 big [IPOs](https://ibb.co/23ZKRbh) will come on Thursday as both AirBNB and DoorDash are expected to go public at insanely high valuations.

After the close today we will get [Chewy](https://ibb.co/mbPdtQx) earnings results and I expect the company to dazzle and to crush them, as pets have become more and more popular this year.

DD,The Affirm IPO and A New Way to Rip People Off,59,k96yrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k96yrw/the_affirm_ipo_and_a_new_way_to_rip_people_off/,37,1607472553.0,"So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of ""offers"" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity.

**TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and ""buy now, pay later"" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age**

**EDIT 1: There's no IPO date schedule. Will probably be early next year**

For the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments.

Starting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has [estimated revenue](https://growjo.com/company/Sezzle) of \~30M.  Sezzle reported in February that they had achieved 1M users and now with the pandemic are estimated to be around 1.8M. 6 months ago they brought in [former PayPal executive](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paul-paradis-promoted-to-company-president-and-veronica-katz-from-paypal-to-take-chief-revenue-officer-role-301090602.html) Veronica Katz as Chief Revenue Officer. Sezzle [advertises](https://sezzle.com/merchants) its business product as ""Engaging the next generation"" and the ability to ""unlock millions of users and increase sales with zero risk"".

Next is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They [reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afterpay-announces-full-year-results-301119541.html) their year ending June 30 and revenue topped **$11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants.** There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at.

This company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. [VP Xin Ge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xin-ge-b6b258?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) 7 years at paypal, [Dana Stalder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcstalder/?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, [Amanda Pires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandapires1/) 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks

At this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is [Max Levchin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/) who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's [partnership](https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-power-shopify-shop-pay-installments) with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's >200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the [investors](https://equityzen.com/company/affirm/) in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future.

**Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential. Affirm is going to IPO and its rocket both short term and long term**",2020-12-08 19:09:13
Discussion,Earnings pre GME thread,100,k96n2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k96n2a/earnings_pre_gme_thread/,154,1607471523.0,"if ur like me ur networth is gonna change for worse (or maybe even better) in like 6 hours and probably oscillate wildly through the week. How are you playing earnings? The OI on this option chain is literally fucking insane btw. Within 2 dollars of current price there are 15k put options expiring this week and 9k call options, which notionally control 2.4 million shares so like 3 or 4% of float or whatever

Next week has an even more absurd amount of put options OI - fucking 30k of put options within 2 dollars of current share price, only 10k of call options so 4 million shares notional

That's straight up 10% of float that is in options within 2 dollars of share price expiring within the next 10 days, this shit is gonna be volatile af and I wish I knew how to figure out how to play tomorrow but alas I'm too dumb, as IV gets crushed though all these strike points are going to become pretty strong gamma inflection points is my guess. 

Another interesting point is that the borrow rate has increased from 11% or whatever a week ago to 28% yesterday and today. 

Catalysts for today's call

* Management still hasn't really given Microsoft revenue details
* Addressing Cohen's concerns
* GME stopped buybacks until 2021 but given the new administration which may try to limit buybacks is there a chance that management yeets their roll into share buy backs before Buyden and co. run things?

How are you playing earnings? Anyone looking to buy any dips in AH?

I'm pretty much just standing pat rn, maybe 10% of my position is in calls expiring January and the rest are further out calls/shares so I'm just gonna ride this thru if we dip hard and probably cry to you all about it or whatever. Don't really have much more money left to buy any dips unfortunately",2020-12-08 18:52:03

# Financial Ratios   

**1.**  **Profitability**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/375fj2t82z361.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=899f559dc97760149c3f2d3c9f8932a6453033d7

 i.  Profit Margin 

The figure above shows that NVidia’s revenue generating in terms of cost have slightly improved with a value of 0.620, compared to 0.612 in 2019. 

 ii.  Operating Margin 

The chart above shows NVidia’s ability to generate cash from its operating activities have slightly decreased, however, it is anticipated that the operating revenue will significantly improve in the Q4 2020.

**2.**  **Management Effectiveness**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bolyn3ra2z361.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e9cfd5be1a116b660faa7ceeb9fec52e576af0

 i.  ROA 

The Return on Assets on NVidia for 2020 was 0.61, dropped from 0.31 in 2019 showing the company’s lack of efficiency in utilizing its assets to generate sales. 

 ii.  ROE

Similarly, the Return on Equity also decreased from 0.44 in 2019 to 0.23 in 2020. 

**3.**  **Liquidity Ratios**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bjg1kndc2z361.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=033c09b6ee349b7f1cad200a5aef7d9dc93c5af6

Liquidity ratios show a company’s both short term and long term cash requirements. Current ratio is slightly lower in 2020 compared to 2019. The 2020 is standing at a current ratio of 7.67 while the 2019 stood at 7.94. 

However, Quick Ratio for 2020 is significantly higher compared to 2019; with 2020 standing at a value of 7.13 while 2019 was 6.76. Quick ratio has improved, so overall we can draw a positive result. 

**4.**  **Stock Price History** 

https://preview.redd.it/yspx4quw1z361.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=92fe6fdf530001e69488308edabe22b9cc4f13be

**Recommendation:**

A 12 month forecast of NVIDIA shows that the stock is estimated to top 700; a median of 600. **Aka CALLS CALLS CALLS.**  The median estimate showed a +10.2% increase from the last price of the stock at $544. Current analysis of NVIDIA shows a strong buy rating and the rating has been steady since November 2020. The company’s PE ratio is below the average with a value of 88.98 which makes the stock undervalued; making the stock look even more attractive to “Buy.” Moreover, the company’s cash flow has also improved as well as the liquidity position has improved. However, there are no massive threats that could potentially harm the company’s profit margins in coming years and consensus regarding the performance are positive and a “healthy” margin is expected in near future. I would give a “Super Fucking Buy” recommendation of NVIDIA for the Q4 of 2020 and looks like the forecasts earnings will be outrun by the company’s performance

***Intro***

Hi all, ya'll might remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6u2m2/thank_you_all_for_changing_my_life/). I made my money researching value stocks and buying a combination of calls and shares to minimize risk and maximize rewards. 

TROX has been one of my money makers. On 11/9, [I bought 2 $12 2/19 calls at $1.7.](https://puu.sh/GVq9K/44e6cdd8db.png) On 11/24, [I bought 3 more $12 2/19 calls at 1.85.](https://puu.sh/GVqbw/95e814e872.png). On 12/7, [I sold 1 call at 2.97](https://puu.sh/GVqdI/46c2031941.png), [3 $12 2/19 calls at 3.00](https://puu.sh/GVq92/3944c6aa44.png), and [1 call at 3.20](https://puu.sh/GVqea/dc08f11ac6.png). In one month, I made a 69.5% profit strictly on these calls.

Today, I am reinvesting in TROX and buying as many $16 5/21 calls and stocks at market open so I can 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

***Company Data***

Tronox Holding PLC produces titanium products. [Titanium prices crashed around 2016 to $4,100 from a high of $16,700 in 2006.](https://puu.sh/GVqkX/c6c28bdd21.png) **Ever since then, the price of Titanium has been steadily going back up (!!!).**

**Price per Earning - 2.29x compared to an industry average of 104.47 (!!!)**

Price per Book - 1.35x compared to an industry average of 5.27

**Price per Earning Growth - .0457x (!!!!!) compared to an industry average of 1.01**

**Dividend Yield - 1.92% compared to 1.86 industry average. Most companies in the industry don't pay a dividend (!!!)**

***Personal Thoughts***

The value of this stock is insane. It has already recovered from the Corona crash and is up 20.73% to $14.62 from it's pre-Corona high of $12.11 this year and shows no signs of slowing down. It's earning growth is through the roof and I believe it will continue to do so as both the economy recovers and the price of Titanium recovers. I was originally happy with my initial profit, but after doing more research, I'm more than happy to jump back in for the long term and ride this ship to the moon.

As with all of my posts, please feel free to ask questions, critique, and analyze my comments. Regardless of how it goes, I will post an update on my position so we can analyze what went right/wrong.",2020-12-08 16:16:21

BFT is the ticker.

BFT services huge companies: TWITCH, DRAFTKINGS, FORTNITE, SPOTIFY. It will grow as their customers grow.

Here is the investor presentation:

This is a Spac so proceed with caution. I think this could be an easy 30-40% gain after merger due to the low multiple of price to sales. Expected 2021 Revenue of 1.5B and a market cap of 9B.....

I bought some common stock.

DD,Big D DD,18,k9378b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9378b/big_d_dd/,29,1607458669.0,"**The Great Bubble of 2020**  
&nbsp;


We all know that the market is in a major bubble and we also all know that all bubbles pop eventually. The problem is that eventually can be a very long time. The [M2 money stock](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2) has been posted multiple times already but rarely are the [M1 stock](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1) and the [MZM stock.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZM) MZM is the Money Zero Money stock and indicates the value of the M2 supply minus small denomination time deposits plus institutions. It gives us a better picture of what the big players are doing with their cash reserves that the M2 doesn't show. Combining all three [graphs](https://i.redd.it/lks874atux361.png) together show us the total inflation of money supply over time.  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Why Do These Matter?**  
&nbsp;


We can look at the major indices and see that they follow each other pretty accurately over time [raw](https://i.redd.it/zik8tmjbyx361.png) but to see it more cleanly, here's the same info against a [log scale.](https://i.redd.it/djsjckhwnx361.png) Now we can see that according to all of these charts that not only do stocks always go up, but we also have plenty of room for them to go up further. This is further supported by viewing [SPX/MZM](https://i.redd.it/578tch32ux361.png) and [SPX/M2.](https://i.redd.it/2ogvc8xcsx361.png) Now I can already hear you saying ""but Prop, these graphs are the same thing. Why post the same thing twice?"" The answer is that because the MZM shows institutional money supply and M2 doesn't, we might expect that these graphs shouldn't be the same. We can also look at the [SPX/M1.](https://i.redd.it/br1bw2e4xx361.png) Since we have a sharp drop off at the end there we can interpret that as people moving liquidity into savings or other assets.  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**How Housing Plays In**  
&nbsp;

 
If you've been living under a rock you probably don't know that on Dec 31st the [forebearacne provision of the CARES act ends.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/mortgage-relief/) What does that mean for us? Looking at the [mortgage delinquency rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS) we can see that come Jan 1st, we're going to potentially have a slew of bankruptcies as homeowners get foreclosed upon. For those of you who've seen The Big Short, you'll know that mortgage backed securities are still widely used and how it doesn't take high percentages of defaults to detonate them. The problem the first time was giving mortgages to people who wouldn't qualify for a payday loan. This time, the ineffective measures taken by the gov mean many otherwise credit worthy individiuals are now sub-prime, through no fault of their own.  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Why This Falls Apart**  
&nbsp;


Now that we've got some background info. We can look at the [buffett indicator](https://i.redd.it/8g9mhit24y361.png) to see that the equity markets are insanely overvalued. Here's where hard data stops and my conjecture starts. We currently have a market heated to dot-com levels. That by itself doesn't mean anything. We didn't have the fed actively screwing with the bond market then. JPOW and presumably Janet Yellen remain committed to infinite QE to protect busisness from the slightest risk of bankruptcy. What they can't do is give money directly to people. This creates the situation where we have a K-shaped recovery actively happening. It works great, as long as average people can service their debt. The problem comes in on Jan 1st when the insulation of the CARES act ends and Congress currently doesn't seem interested in getting another round of stimulus going. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**What Does That Mean For The Market?**  
&nbsp;


If Congress doesn't see fit to bestow upon the plebs some Trump/Biden bux we can see that we'll likely see widespread housing defaults/foreclosures. Most people don't like to be homeless, especially in winter, so anyone who's in that situation who also has stock holdings would be highly motivated to sell to afford to pay their now urgent mortgage. The MBSs securitizing these mortgages will crumble if enough households fail to raise the cash to pay off their loan as a result. This can be entirely averted if stimmy happens and even if it doesn't, it's unlikely that all of this will happen before late Feb-March. It won't be a fast process by any means and Congress could end it at any time by getting their act together and passing something.

Although still in its early stages, this is an amazing step forward in using AI in critical areas like healthcare. I have been an investor in NVIDIA since 2016 and its been one heck of a ride (just like TSLA, PLTR, AMZN, AAPL, DKNG, U). While TSLA is by far my largest position, I have been steadily increasing my NVDA position as well - for years. I think it's time we gave a serious look to this Rocket Ship 🚀🚀🚀🚀",2020-12-08 10:00:20
DD,Board the rocket that is *VXRT*,64,k8z28f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8z28f/board_the_rocket_that_is_vxrt/,32,1607437320.0,"So here is some DD from myself. Myself being an admitted amateur, but knows how to read patterns and news when I see it. Tired of seeing the word PLTR? Well, in a short couple of months you may get tired of seeing VXRT.

**What is VXRT?**

Vaxart, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company, engages in the discovery and development of oral recombinant protein vaccines based on its proprietary oral vaccine platform. The company's product pipeline includes norovirus vaccine, an oral tablet vaccine, which has completed Phase I clinical trials with bivalent oral tablet vaccine for the GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus strains; seasonal influenza vaccine, which is in Phase II clinical trials for treatment of H1 influenza infection; respiratory syncytial virus vaccine; and coronavirus vaccine. It is also developing therapeutic immune-oncology vaccines for cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus. The company has a research collaboration agreement with Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Janssen) to evaluate the company's proprietary oral vaccine platform for the Janssen universal influenza vaccine program. Vaxart, Inc. is headquartered in South San Francisco, California. 

&#x200B;

**YTD History**

VXRT was a penny stock coming into the new year and quickly found its feet mid summer rocketing up to 15 per share, 5 dollar short of its 5 YR ATH in 2016. VXRT has been trading relatively sideways for the past couple of weeks and is teetering on being an interplanetary rocket that soars well past the moon. 

&#x200B;

**My Research and Thoughts**

VXRT will be offering among many other vaccines, and ORAL COVID-19 vaccine. That's right, oral. Now, Why is this huge you might ask? Well for starters the current vaccines are sensitive to specific temperatures and makes transportation ,storage, and administration a large hurdle. With a pill form it can be distributed en mass, globally, in any regular package. This not only relieves staffing issue to administer a vaccine on such a grand scale, but also allows many people that have a huge fear of needles to take it in an oral form. 

The company is getting ready to publish phase 1 trials and finding with word of this happening around December 10. They recently hired a team of 5 manufacturing experts and have quality control expert job openings, which to me signals a need for an all hands on deck operation for when the manufacturing officially starts soon. Vaxart will be the first company to actually bring out mucosal immunity. 

There are grumblings of a **Bill Gates** connection with a new Stanford hire at VXRT. If you dig deep enough, things start to get pretty interesting. Pfizer also recently came out and said that they would have trouble with initial demand for the vaccine and might not have enough till summer of 2021, in turn allowing other major players to enter the market and crush. Joe Biden said it himself, 

 ***“Cost of actually getting the serum into an injection needle into someone’s arm costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of people. It takes a lot of folks to get this done. We have to have a much better way than what we have seen to get this distributed.”*** 

&#x200B;

Here is some nice DD from someone I have no affiliation with but backs up my thoughts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuofzQ73An0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuofzQ73An0)

&#x200B;

**TLDR**

There is risk. But this risk will pay off. A pill form vaccine is going to take us to the moon. Once funding is secured my bets are on a moon past 30 by first quarter.

It may not sound like the sexiest play, but this stock is being acquired in big chunks by big players.  

https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc

Michael Burry’s Sicon bought 800,000 shares in Q3. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/mason-hawkins-southeastern-strengthens-connection-192315526.html

Southeastern Asset Management, the investment firm founded by Mason Hawkins (Trades, Portfolio) in 1975, disclosed it increased its stake in Lumen Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) by 3.66% last week.  The firm invested in 2.3 million shares of the Monroe, Louisiana-based telecommunications company on Dec. 3, impacting the equity portfolio by 0.62%. The stock traded for an average price of $10.51 per share on the day of the transaction.

They have also been awarded significant government contracts this year:

They have also partnered with ZM:

https://www.lightreading.com/the-edge/lumen-to-partner-with-zoom/d/d-id/765631


***What’s interesting is the stock took a major hit on Monday evening after hours when it was announced:

FCC Subsidy Results Dim Lumen's Financial Outlook -- Market Talk
Mentioned:	CHTR LUMN
15:29 ET - Shares of Lumen sink more than 5% Monday after Federal Communications Commission data show the telecom company formerly called CenturyLink won about $26M a year under the latest round of federal subsidies for rural broadband service. The new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund payouts come well below the hundreds of millions in annual cash CenturyLink enjoyed under past programs, endangering a stable revenue source. Filling the void with more winning bids: new players like cable operator Charter Communications and SpaceX. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald) 

Many saw this as a huge blow to revenues, but this was business that sharps believe LUMN did not want to win due to the low margins. 

Plus they have more lucrative contracts already locked up and we all know Elon has no problem running in the red to build a business. 

Actually there were more bidders for ever for this business and the FCC had set aside $16B for this auction and only had to use $9.6B - it was a race to the bottom. 

The average 10-day volume before the dip after hours was 10MM shares a day. 

The next day over 16MM volume and the stock rebounded - it was a buying opportunity for the heavy hitters to add on the dip and they did. 

Today the overall market pulled back and LUMN was up again on higher than normal volume - 13MM. 

It is being acquired by institutions, also the dividend is very attractive for these types of investors that hold 5-7 years. 

The play on LUMN is 5G fiber and here is how:

CenturyLink can thrive in a 5G world
Despite this massive, long-term decline, it could see an upswing as analysts forecast an increase in profits. Why? Put simply, instead of destroying CenturyLink, 5G may have saved the company.

As it so happens, 5G networks remain heavily dependent on fiber. From an infrastructure perspective, the biggest difference between the previous 4G LTE standard and the current 5G is the number of cells needed. Instead of one cell every few miles, 5G requires numerous small cells located close to one another. 

As a result, carriers have exponentially more cells, and they all need to connect to their networks. To do this, carriers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will need CenturyLink's fiber. Hence, instead of fiber becoming obsolete, it may become more important than ever to the telecom industry.

Which brings me to:

An old company with a new name
Will Healy (Lumen Technologies): The fiber company long known as CenturyLink has become an afterthought as consumers increasingly embrace wireless. Moreover, some investors might assume that a wireless telco industry makes fiber networks obsolete.

They should think again.

The exponentially higher number of 5G antennas will depend in large measure on fiber networks for backhaul. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) will also rely heavily on fiber to enable edge computing.


Additionally, Lumen is also well positioned for a popular Democratic program -- rural broadband. Based in Monroe, Louisiana, Lumen has used its network to offer high-speed internet to some rural areas. This could help Joe Biden, who has pledged broadband for ""every American"" in an effort to reach rural voters. Biden also worked to expand broadband access when he was vice president.

Lumen stock has experienced a secular decline since 2007 as consumers dropped landlines and cable TV. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than eight does not seem so cheap given tepid earnings growth. Furthermore, missed deadlines on SEC filings and a falling dividend have also hurt the stock.

However, even the reduced annual dividend of $1.00 per share still yields just over 9%. Also, with a free cash flow of $803 million exceeding the $291 million cost of its dividend in its most recent quarter, the payout should remain safe.

Regardless of who wins the election, Lumen stock could benefit as the company repurposes its network to support 5G and IoT. Nonetheless, if a Biden administration subsidizes rural broadband, Lumen could receive an additional boost.

In summary, this is not Century Link anymore, it’s something much different and ready to be a 5G PLAYER.  

I would have YOLO’d this one as well as I have 140 January 2022 $15c at an average of .50. 

I believe this has the legs and from what I laid out here think $30-40 could be realistic by Q4 2021.

In all likelihood, the stock will open much higher than that. I think Airbnb is a great potential long term buy given that it's IPOing at the worst possible time for travel industry in general. This was the toughest year for Airbnb. Contrast this with DoorDash which had the best year because everyone was avoiding going out. Wall Street is short-sighted. It only sees 2020 revenues and makes foolish decisions. You can be smarter than that. Would you want to invest in a company about to become a travel behemoth and had the worst possible year and and only has good things to look forward to or would you invest in a food-delivery company whose pandemic-fueled, covid-inspired best year is already behind it.

Airbnb has already received a couple upgrades before the IPO. 

Barrons had good things to say about it: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/airbnbs-ipo-will-be-hot-why-its-stock-will-be-worth-the-price-51607120966](https://www.barrons.com/articles/airbnbs-ipo-will-be-hot-why-its-stock-will-be-worth-the-price-51607120966)

I am not a big fan of Scott Galloway but he wrote a neat article on Airbnb and its valuation: [https://www.profgalloway.com/airbnballer](https://www.profgalloway.com/airbnballer)

&#x200B;

I was also impressed with how Brian Chesky handled the Covid pandemic and how Airbnb stepped up to help healthcare workers. Even during fires in states like California, I have seen Airbnb step-up to help first-responders and evacuees. Before the pandemic hit, Airbnb was expected to IPO at over $50B valuation. A conservative firm like Airbnb was valuing Airbnb at $53B - $65B back in 2018.

In the pre-Covid era it was one of the rare profitable startups.

I don't know where it will open but anything under $100 is worth a very serious consideration. Just my 2 cents.

The stock is down big and people are saying it’s because of the vaccine news since this means less testing (retards say this). The real reason is it went on a massive run before and after last earnings. Why? Because RT-qPCR tests and other testing equipment/reagents they sell account for $8 billion or 25% of their quarterly revenue.

Let me be clear here: TESTING HAS NOT SLOWED DOWN AND WILL NOT SLOW DOWN BECAUSE OF A VACCINE. The amount of testing from Q3 will be significantly smaller than the testing we will see in Q4. Why? Because RT-qPCR is the gold standard of testing and TMO has one of, if not THE, best kits out there. Plus everyone in science knows TMO and will have no problem relying on their kits.

You can also look at my older post from Q3 for more details.

They will make more revenue from selling freezers, too, but please stfu about this being why TMO is a buy right now. That’s idiotic. It’s their diagnostics, plastics, reagents, and manufacturing that will boost revenue.

One smaller player that has caught my eye that hasn't had the same type of multi-bagger run yet is PERI (Perion Network). These guys have been around for a long time, but have recently started to revamp their business with some good acquisitions and added revenue streams in the last few years.

Great SA article posted yesterday which goes into a hell of a lot more detail and analysis than I will in this post (yeah, yeah, it's SA, but the article itself is actually pretty decent--go find it because I can't link it here). But the bottom line is things are looking solid heading into 2021 here. Just upped their guidance for next quarter, analysts targets all above current price with ""buy"" ratings, and they just renewed a four-year Microsoft contract expected to generate revenue between $170-190 million annually (according to their investor slide deck). Yes, that's close to a billion dollar contract with Microsoft for a company trading at a market cap of less than than $300 million. This is trading at a huge discount right now and could be an easy multi-bagger from here in my opinion. Stupidly undervalued right now in this sector compared to competitors (MGNI is the most comparable play in my opinion). Oh, by the way, Cathie and ARK are in here as well, with 160k shares as their third biggest holding in their IZRL ETF.

Buy in, or don't, I don't really care. But check it out if you are looking for new play that isn't TSLA, PLTR, or NIO (I'm loaded up in those as well, but I have to keep myself entertained with finding new stuff).

Anyway, I'll probably get downvotes for ""PuMpInG a SmAlL CaP,"" but oh well, i don't care if you buy or not. Do your own research, but this has been a money maker for me this week and wanted to put it on a few people's radars. Sure, it's a small cap, but it's a small float that can move quickly with good volume. Also, option volume and liquidity is actually pretty damn good with tight spreads usually (check out the OI on April 10c, lotta people been loading up and holding). It has had a great week on huge volume (2,000% above average) after raising guidance on Monday, and it also held up exceptionally well today despite the NASDAQ taking a fat dump. I bought a decent lot of April 10C contracts at open yesterday that I am up over 150% on already, but I am holding for a possible five to ten bagger here. Still accumulating shares at this level as well. A lot of upside potential here in my opinion. My near term price target is $15 by early 2021. $20 would then be my likely exit point on all of my calls (unless I am feeling greedy, which happens way too often, so probably....).

[https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-013518/](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-013518/)

From what I gather the SNOW S-1 filing was officially submitted on sept 14th, and the 91st day from this is Monday Dec 14th. Another website I found confirmed this. SNOW insiders can then sell about 3 million shares or \~10% of the float, so maybe just a small dip happens then, but the next one they can sell \~9 million shares or \~25% of the float which could be a great short opportunity.

**""The second trading day immediately following the day that the closing price of our Class A common stock on The New York Stock Exchange exceeds 133% of the initial public offering price as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, for at least 10 trading days in the 15 trading day period following the 90th day after the date of this prospectus.""**

Confusing enough for ya? It only took me a few hours to work this out..

Initial public offering price appears to be $245, and 133% of this is $325.85, which SNOW can likely hold above.

The 90th day is dec 13th + 10 trading days above $325.85 + 2 days = thursday dec 31st liquidation occurs? (christmas is not a trading day, but christmas eve counts as a day I believe, even tho it is technically a half day).

This correct? I think these f\*cks intentionally worded it this way to keep the public from realizing what day they can legally sell to prevent a panic sell off.

Idk about you, but if I had 30,000+ shares at $6.78 average, I'd definitely be taking the full 25% profit allowable on dec 31st at $371/share **(5400% unrealized gain)**. I hope this post saves a few retail investors that bought in not knowing this

Also, SNOW has 184x price to sales ratio and buffet bought in at $100 just 3 months ago.

[Short Interest update for the 30th of November is 67.98M up from 67.45M](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts). Yes the shorts never covered jack shit. I hope people remember that almost everyone insisted that people buy shares or Jan or April calls not fucken weeklies.

1. [Reported loss of 53 cents vs loss of 85 cents expected. Revenue 1.0B vs 1.09B expected.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-gme-falls-despite-narrower-144802231.html)

3. No mention of Cohen or Microsoft Deal.

Just want to let people know that that 100m dollars (**NOT SHARES**) in dilution is just an option. Management put it out there either to make some $ when this short squeeze and/or to fend off Cohen for a bit. If you listen on the conference call. [Here’s the link but I'll just cut to the chase.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

*William Reuter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst*

*OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?*

*George Sherman -- Chief Executive Officer*

*No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.*

*And we're not immune to that, right? And, in that regard, look, we're going to continue to execute our strategies that have bolstered and strengthen our balance sheet. And you see all the work that we've done, including, if we go back to even the long-term debt levels in early 2019 until today, it's -- you know, as of this coming Friday will have reduced our long-term debt over $530 million, by March of '21, they'll be over $600 million. In that same timeframe, that same roughly 24-month timeframe, plus or minus, we also returned over $200 million to shareholders. So, I think -- look, the goal is to continue to focus on running the business and optimizing we run the business, but also be very pragmatic and make sure that we have capital flexibility with no intention to do anything other than maintain our flexibility.*

*Hopefully that helps you.*

*Jim Bell -- Chief Financial Officer*

*And as far as \[Inaudible\] is concerned, we don't need it. We don't need it. Bottom line.*

What now?

Since this earnings the only thing that has changed is that management is confirmed to be survival mode to save their jobs because Cohen wants to kick them out. [Check Jeff’s DD on GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/) and ask yourself how much of that has changed? Nothing.

Everyone knew that earnings was going to be shit since this quarter marks the END of the console cycle.

For all the doomsayers and fucken 1 ply toilet paper hands, you probably sold and took the loss after you got your ass handed to you by yours truly Melvin Capital. [Here you can see how the # of shares available dropped from 45k to 1k and fees basically skyrocketed.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) Short the shit out of the stock and hit all those stop losses and paint a terrible earnings picture for GME.

This isn’t the first time, last earnings they did the same shit (September 9,2020) stock went from 7.35$ to 6.23$ only to rocket up to 9$ in a week. They do this shit every earnings.

GameStop is like PLTR, manipulated to hell by hedge funds except for GameStop they ran out of ammo (SI over 100% and they are underwater) and they’re firing blanks at you.

DD,RAVN - Cathie and ARKQ's next Baby,158,ka1w6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ka1w6j/ravn_cathie_and_arkqs_next_baby/,54,1607580556.0,"Alright you degens, here's the deal. Raven Industries is a small-cap [(but over $1 Billion market capitalization currently)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RAVN/). Their highest market cap range was $1.75B in [September of 2018](https://ycharts.com/companies/RAVN/market_cap), with a huge dip due to the 'rona. So mods, don't think I missed the submission rules.

**What Raven Industries Do**

""Applied Technology"" aka fancy tech for farmers. Field computers, guidance/steering, machine control, yada yada. Anything to get Jebediah out of his tractor and behind a tablet.

""Engineered Films"" - you need a big blanket to cover up an entire pond, but specifically made to protect the environment from hydrocarbon contaminants? You get Absolute Barrier Y30BAC, and you get a pond sized liner in a week.

""Aerostar"" - This is the big one. Raven provides quick deployment balloon systems for everything from surveillance and communication systems to monitoring atmospheric conditions. NASA loves these and so does Alphabet/Google [(check out Project Loon)](https://loon.com/), both current Raven customers. They're pretty much satellites you can deploy from the ground that can smell your last FD's rotting corpse from [19 miles high.](https://ravenaerostar.com/aerospace-and-defense/scientific-research)

**WHY YOU ARE BEING SPOON FED ABOUT THIS STOCK**

Our lord and savior, Cathie Wood and ARKQ has [initiated a position on RAVN.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/12/18582800/raven-industries-small-cap-agriculture-balloon-technology-stock-cathie-wood-likes) Moreover, they have since increased their stake from an initial $5 million to a current stake of around [$12 million in 2 months.](https://cathiesark.com/arkq-holdings-of-ravn) That's what prompted me to take a look at some of Raven's performance.

**PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS**

Pulling data from Fidelity's Key Statistics derived from Raven's latest Edgar filings, Raven has some interesting metrics:

Gross Margin (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 40.27%, Avg Industrial Conglomerates 38.06%, putting them in the 75th percentile of Industrials. Solid but not mind blowing.

Return on Equity (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 10.65%, Avg Industrial Conglomerates 11.75%, putting them in the 50th percentile of Industrials. Middle of the pack.

Return on Assets (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): RAVN 8.56%, Avg sector is 3.98%, putting them in the 92nd percentile. Now we're talking.

According to the [Nov 24 earnings report](https://investors.ravenind.com/news-releases/news-release-details/raven-industries-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2021), the applied technology and Aerostar segments saw an increased revenue of 22% and 15% year over year respectively. Tractors go brr, balloons go prrrrt.

Total Debt/Capital (Most Recent Qtr, Annualized): 3.03%, avg of sector is 57.13%. It has *extremely* low debt obligations relative to other industrials. Now normally this is where you say that they're idiots because they're not properly leveraging. But to that I say that this company is ran by a bunch of South Dakotans who listen to Dave Ramsey on their truck radios and avoid debt like its a minority they're not familiar with.

&#x200B;

I've had a lot of bourbon since I started writing this post, so I'll leave with this. I am bullish with 300 shares and 10 calls at varying strikes for May 2021 (furthest out I could go). The current options sentiment is massively bullish. I'm talking Call/Put ratio of 434:1 for today's volume, open interest C:P is 27:1. For the smoother of brains out here, that means that we can't have a bear hunting season, because thus far we cannot determine whether bears even exist.

DD,Airbnb IPO is cheap at $60/share.,26,ka0rps,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ka0rps/airbnb_ipo_is_cheap_at_60share/,74,1607577027.0,"Edit: updated price for the capital raise is $68/share. And yes, I understand it is likely impossible to get any shares below $100. But stop crying about it and at least try to do so. Congrats to all that got shares as hosts or on secondary markets earlier.

&#x200B;

Airbnb (ABNB) is going public tomorrow aiming for a valuation of $42B or $60/share. This is cheap. The bankers are pricing it, as if it is another Uber/Lyft. Whereas in reality is multiple times better as it can become a high margin business. **Price target: $150/share**. Let me explain why.

# Unique supply

The long-tail of Airbnb hosts tends to be lazy and only list their properties on Airbnb. Which is great as it makes it a must visit platform for guests. This contrary to Uber/Lyft where all drivers/customers are on both and pricing is all that matters for the consumer.

&#x200B;

[Source: skift\/Mckinsey](https://preview.redd.it/2y42jyhz48461.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f48afbdf2814fbfe6c45d645d81f07d9dbb17d)

# Demand comes for free

91% of visitors are organic/direct, meaning that they don’t pay for them with marketing. This contrary to platforms like booking.com that are burning most of their margin on Google ads. This is firstly driven by the above mentioned unique content offering. Secondly it is driven by Airbnb’s focus on user experience. Basically making the platform pleasant to use. Which results in an Airbnb you want to use, and a booking.com which you have to use because the algos make you. This brings potential for margin expansion because you don’t have to grow marketing spend in order to grow revenue (decoupling these = extra profit margin!).

# Margin expansion

Even though above characteristics should make it relatively easy to turn a decent profit for Airbnb, they have historically mainly written losses. Currently they blow all the margin on refunds, too many developers, and an expensive office in SF, etc. Yet, if during the next 10 years they focus on the bottom line it could become a great 30-40% margin business. This would bring it in line with marketplaces that enjoy similar 'winner takes most' characteristics such as horizontal classifieds and property platforms. Details below on the potential costs as % of revenue.

|*Component*|*Airbnb 2020*|*Booking 2020*|*Airbnb 2030*|*Logic*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Operations, support, refunds,|40%|10%|23%|Stop being overly nice to customers and giving everyone refunds.|
|Marketing/ sales|32%|39%|12%|See above points on demand. Airbnb can afford to spend less on marketing and maintain traffic.|
|Product development|17%|10%|12%|Get in line with industry|
|Admin/management|13%|5%|5%|idem|
|Total|102%|64%|60%|Resulting in a 40% margin|

&#x200B;

# Valuation

**Key assumptions:**

* 9% market share 2030 vacation short stays from today 3.1% (tripling number of hosts)
* 14% take rate → $27B revenue in 2030
* EBITDA margin expansion to 40% in 2030 (see above)
* Terminal value based on exit multiple of 30 times earnings (booking is at 60)
* Discount rate: 10% (thing boomers use to value future cash)
* **Resulting in:**
   * **Market cap:** $110B (booking as reference is $87B)
   * **Price target:** $150/share

Discussion,Behavioral Finance: You’re Retarded Explained,183,k9zxon,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zxon/behavioral_finance_youre_retarded_explained/,56,1607574536.0,"As I am watching my portfolio sink into the literal pits of hell, I figured I will make a post that might help some of the ~~investors~~ retards on this sub better understand why they do what they do so that they can recognize and then overcome some of the blind spots in their decision making.   

I will start off with a brief intro into BF, then I will list off some emotional and cognitive biases that retail investors are notorious for exhibiting. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will become more self-aware of what you are doing and become that much closer to someone that doesn’t lose his rent money on a regular basis. 

**What is Behavioral Finance (BF)**

To put it in simplest terms, BF attempts to understand and explain observed investor and market behaviors. 

You are all familiar with traditional, neo-classical finance where it assumes investors are risk-averse (lol), maximize utility (level of satisfaction received from the consumption of goods and services), and the markets are efficient in every single way. BF essentially says that’s all bullshit because in reality, people are seldom rational and cannot possibly consider all available information when making a decision, therefore, the markets are not efficient at all. 

To put it in layman’s terms, just like two wrongs don’t make a right, BF states that stuffing a million retards on Robinhood doesn’t make an Einstein. 

**Emotional Bias**

1. Loss Aversion Bias: People tend to strongly prefer avoiding losses as opposed to gains. This will cause people to hold on to failing securities. This is a big one on this sub. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for strong hands and all but recognize when you’re in a bad play and don’t be afraid to get out. 

2. Overconfidence Bias: Unwarranted faith in their own intuitive reasoning, judgement, and cognitive ability. This is a big one and is shown every time someone yolo their life savings on far OTM options. 

3. Self-Control Bias: Failure to act in pursuit of their long-term goals due to a lack of self-discipline. This is anyone in GME gang that paper handed and sold at open without realizing that the long term play is to bank on this company turning around starting in 20Q4 and triggering a short squeeze. 

4. Status Quo Bias: Doing nothing instead of making a change. Example are those that never closed their TSLA puts. 

5. Regret-Aversion Bias: Avoid making decisions that will result in action out of fear that decision will turn out poorly. Stop being a pussy. 

**Cognitive Errors**

1. Cognitive Dissonance: mental discomfort that occurs when new information conflicts with previously held beliefs. This is shown when people only notice information that confirm existing biases and ignore conflicting points of view. 

2. Conservation Bias: People maintain prior views by inadequately incorporating new information. Will often result in being too slow to update their viewpoints and end up bag holding major losses. A good example are those that diamond handed SPY puts in March. 

3. Confirmation Bias: people only look for and notice what confirms their own beliefs and ignore those that contradict. An example can be virtually any “gang” that existed in WSB history. Tanker gang, silver gang, etc. 

4. Representativeness Bias: people classify new information based on past experience and not realize that just because something happened in the past does not mean it is repeating itself right now. An example can be anytime someone compares the March crash to 08 or 1929. 

5. Anchoring Bias: Use of a psychological heuristic that influences the way people estimate probabilities. This is every time someone says stocks are at an ATH, why should I buy? Without looking at the fundamentals that drove the stock there to begin with

6. Mental Accounting Bias: Treating one sum of money differently to another equal sum. Money is money, get over it. 

7. Framing Bias: answering a question differently based on way it is asked. 

8. Availability Bias: people take a heuristic approach to estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily outcome comes to mind. Everytime stocks dip 5-7% I guarantee you there will be posts saying the crash is here simply because people can easily remember March. 

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, before making a decision, ask yourself if any of these biases apply to you. If so, you are probably not thinking straight and acting like a total retard. All of these biases can be countered by having a clear head, understand your risk tolerance and return objectives, and having a clear long term strategy.",2020-12-09 23:28:56

DD,"Why the Market is becoming the Economy: A Tale of Two Liquidities (SPY, stimulus, repos)",71,k9zcbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zcbo/why_the_market_is_becoming_the_economy_a_tale_of/,17,1607572799.0,"This is super long, so if you don't wanna read it skip to the TLDR.  This also isn't a revolutionary thesis, ""we need stimmy!"" but I wanted to breakdown why it's important, at least in my view.

**Long story short:** the importance of this year's booming rally has largely hinged on: a)increased liquidity through FED repo lending mechanisms and b) dramatically increased consumer opportunities created by enhanced UI benefits, and where people chose to spend it.  

**1) The rise and fall of FED liquidity via short term loans**

For those who were around in the halcyon days of the late spring and early summer, we witnessed SPY do some amazing things together.  For review, I noted two specific mechanisms that were largely behind the barrage of green dildos raining down daily:

**1a.) *Free money repo operations**:* to simplify it, this is the process by which financial entities borrow money from each other for overnight asset purchases; it's a closed, short term loan ecosystem.  This became a bloated and expensive process in 2019, leading to somewhat of a mini-crisis, and the FED stepped in to offer their own low interest short-term loans. When the March crash came, the FED sent this lending vehicle into hyperdrive, throwing hundreds of billions of dollars a week into low interest short-term loan operations for banks.  How low?

**Free. They were offering overnight swaps with banks, using treasury as collateral, and charging ZERO additional interest on them.**

[Typical Repo operation early 2020](https://i.imgur.com/TmbUXrR.jpg)
you see, IOER plus ZERO BASIS POINTS.  *Literally, free money.*

Since the Spring, SPY has petered out.  Up and down, boomer-esque gains have replaced the BTD logic of summer.  Below is the difference in price and percent for the first trading day in each month compared to the last.  Things got shaky in the fall. (note that it is typically assumed that FED balance sheet adjustments take about one-two months to show results, good or bad)

May to June: 280.43/303 = 8%
June to july: 303/ 309.28= 2% (note below)

July to August (3) = 309.28/ 328.74= **6.2%**

August to September= 328.74/ 351.19= **6.8%**

September to October = 351.19/ 337.04= **-4.19%**

October to November = 337.04/ 330.20= **2%**

November to December= 330.20/ 366.02= **10.84%** (note below)

**The 3 days preceding and following the election were responsible for 7.3% of the November rise, so Nov is something of an outlier. The 2% in June came due to the crash, which was caused by the very thing I'm solidifying--a change in the Fed overnight loan terms)

Also since the Spring, the amount of people participating in overnight Repo operations has petered out.  Why? Because it's not longer free money.  **The FED's bread and butter liquidity operation for short term loans changed their interest terms.  [This is so important that it was the largest catalyst for the June crash.  Stories broke on the 10th and 11th that the Fed would be  ""tweaking"" the overnight lending rates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-repo-idUSKBN23I39Z), from the ""free money"" 0 points over IOER to 5 points over on the overnight, and 10 points on the term.** Do the math; if the story breaks on the 11th stating the FED would be increasing the rate on their overnight loan operations, and the Street catches wind likely a day or two before that...what do you think causes the crash on the 11th?  The FED program has been steadily increasing to a standard +10 interest charge.

So, the FED has dried up it's free money overnight lending, an it would seem to coincide with SPY slowing down.

**1b.) The end of double pump Tuesdays**
Once upon a time I wrote about the ""Double Pump""--typically on Tuesday--when the FED would offer both term AND overnight repo operations on the same day, at the IOER +0 (free money) rate.  However, once the interest rate climbed to +5 points it became obsolete; it's more common to see zero takers on repo/reverse repo operations than it is to see more than one taker, nowadays.  Tuesdays were guaranteed green at a 90% rate--and then FED lending practices changed, and poof.

The details of all this shit is boring, but the point is this: once the COVID crash hit, in order to grease the wheels to getting the market back on track the FED was employing multiple avenues to give financial entities money to play with mostly via its absurdly low-cost loan swap programs.


These repo lending programs becoming more expensive are apart of a larger general trend; the shrinking FED balance sheet.  Although in recent months they have lightly picked spending back up, we have flatlined from the huge jump we saw in March and April in response to the pandemic. 

[FED balance sheet YTD 2020](https://i.imgur.com/znnvilS.jpg)
Look at that level-off, this shit matters

**2) Stimulus play money go bye-bye**
Stimmy pumps aren't much, unless you're betting 0DTE, but the underlying importance of an economic stimulus that benefits consumers is. There are three simple measures signifying it's importance as a liquidity pump:

**2a.) Consumer spending**: when the stimulus began to hit in April/May, we saw a huge jump in consumer spending.  You remember the lines at WMT and TGT and shit.  In June, for example, consumer spending was expected to increase a little less than 2%--it went higher than 6%.

**2b.) Credit Card Debt begone**: people had so much extra money from the stimulus they paid off their credit cards https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumers-flush-with-stimulus-money-shun-credit-card-debt-11596373201 .  This is a clear indication that the stimulus funds were having a positive spending affect.

**2c.) Consumer choices:** Used auto sales and home sales skyrocketed (link), indicating people were flush with excess cash for down payments, in addition to the ability to pay off debt.
https://www.wsj.com/articles/during-covid-19-pandemic-the-used-car-lot-is-hot-11593774001

**Conclusion**
So what the fuck am I saying?  I'm saying that in order for the market to not reflect and react to current (horrid) employment and opportunity metrics--common measures of economic health being decimated by the COVID/lockdown return-- one of these two external liquidity injections must continue; FED balance sheet ultra expansion, or stimulus injection.  While FED spending on QE is increasing slightly over the past few months, it's paltry in comparison March, April, and May, and is very unlikely to return to those levels.  This is why in every speaking engagement Powell makes it clear: we need a stimulus.

So, the answer to which liquidity injection can continue is the stimulus. Specifically, the enhanced unemployment benefits that, coupled with eviction moratoriums and rent/mortgage deferment, allow consumer spending and credit debt relief on a mass scale.  Regardless of the bickering, it is going to happen.  The enhanced UI will happen, in particular, because more widespread lockdowns are going to hurt jobs numbers, thus lending the Dems the leverage they need.  UI benefits are tied to employment, and even McConnell is acknowledging there is no way around that.

**I see a lot of people talking about the stimulus in the daily thread, so here are some basics:**
1) Direct payments are likely not happening this time, or at a depressed level (talk of $600)
2) UI enhancements will be reinstated at at least $300 extra weekly, backdated to December 1st
3) There will be another eviction moratorium extension, probably for 3, 4 months
4) It doesn't matter what the white house wants--the chain of approval goes House vote (Nancy), then Senate vote (McConnell).  Any vote in either house that hasn't been supported by the other chamber is DOA and pure political stunt.
5) The big hangup is corporate liability protection for Democrats (businesses, schools, hospitals want lawsuit immunity from COVID cases) and State and Local Government Aid for the Democrats (money to be used at the discretion of localities, including social programming, policing, education).
6) Its going to pass this negotiation cycle because it's tied to a government shutdown.


**Positions: Arming for the next round of stimulus**


SPY: stay away, honestly.  Even after the initial pump, there will still be several rounds of voting needed, between committees and chambers, each with it's own bad news cycle days and good news cycle days.


I'm also staying away from small cap trash and looking at companies who most benefit from restriction rules, integrated online systems well, or both.  I had a good sense this dip was coming yesterday, so I'm loading up on these at EOD:

Strong consumer-spending retail:
**WMT: 1/8 155c**
**TGT: 1/8 180c**

Consumer electronics that boomed in lockdown 1:

**AAPL: 1/8 126c**
**HPQ: 1/15 25c**

Once people realize that telehealth is here to stay, TDOC merger is actually dope as fuck, and vaccine logistics are going to take forever:
TDOC 12/24 200c
TDOC 1/15 205c

I just fucking like TOL, so 
**TOL 1/15 46c**

**TLDR: To stave off a bear market reflecting wider economic conditions, we need a continuation of either 0 interest FED short-term loan programs or an economic stimulus—stimulus is more likely. SPY, without these two things, has shown waning strength over the past few months.  Buy calls like the stimulus is coming in the next few weeks, but stay away from SPY generally and pick consumer-spending winners with dual in-person/online presence.**",2020-12-09 22:59:59

At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer – relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**. Before we dive into what the company actually does, here is the overview of the company. 

**Financial wise, the company has**

\- **A whopping 71% yoy growth**

\- **86% subscription revenue**

\- **A $271 billion TAM by 2024.** 

\- **Narrowing income loss thanks to the rapid growth**

**The AI technology is a proven technology and is one that is being used daily to help industries moving faster into digital transformation. The currently capability and usage of the AI software is as followed** 

\- **Make 1.1Billion predictions per day**

\- **Has 4.8million machine learning models in production use**

\- **Has 622 million sensors generating data for the C3.AI suite**

\- **Has 770 unique enterprise and extraprise source data integration** 

\- **Has 50 Million businesses and consumers touched daily**

**Notable market successes:**

\- **Banks are able to enhance securities lending optimization with estimated value of 14 billion in additional daily trades deployed in 52 weeks**

\- **Healthcare managements are able to enhance production optimization with estimated value of 300% increase in unit production deployed in 4 weeks**

\- **Oil and gas companies are able to predictive maintenance for offshore oil rigs and is able to recapture $28million per year in avoided shutdowns** 

What is C3.AI

C3.ai is an enterprise AI software company that provides software as a service, applications that enable the rapid deployment of enterprise AI applications of extraordinary scale and complexity that offer significant social and economic benefit. 

**Two primary software solutions:**

**1.** **C3 AI suite: designed to allow customers to apply design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI application to any type (basically a platform that allows you to develop your own applications)**

**2.** **C3 AI Application: include a large and growing family of industry specific and application specific turnkey Ai solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed (a prebuilt application that is ready to go for implementations)**

The market entry growth strategy of C3.AI is focus on partnering and coordinating with lighthouse customers (the big companies including AWS, Baker Huges, FIS, Google, IBM and Microsoft) to create a proven and scalable applications that work to increase efficiency, cut down on costs and to record measurements on a massive scale for analysis purposes. With the established applications. 

**C3.AI is then able to** 

**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**

**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**

**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**

Real world user case:

Engie – largest power producer in the world with

\- 114.4 GW power production capacity

\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money

\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties 

With the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**

\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value

\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value

\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment 

\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months 

**Revenue model**

\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**

\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**

\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**

\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**

In the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**

Their AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace & defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** 

\- **Anti-money laundering**

\- **COVID-19 Data lake**

\- **AI CRM**

\- **Energy management**

\- **Fraud detection**

\- **Inventory optimization**

\- **Predictive maintenance**

\- **Production schedule optimization**

\- **Readiness**

\- **Sensor health**

\- **Supply network risk** 

**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.**

Mr Foley’s investment vehicle will also raise close to $2bn in additional funds from institutional investors, including hedge fund Third Point and Hedosophia, the company set up by British investor Ian Osborne who has launched multiple Spacs with Chamath Palihapitiya (The IPOB guy)

Paysafe, which has been dominant in handling online gambling transactions as well as helping retailers process customers’ online payments, was acquired by Blackstone and CVC for £3bn in 2017. As part of the deal with Mr Foley’s Spac the private equity duo will retain a stake in Paysafe.""

I'm here to discuss diamond Hands, paper hands, and why blindly throwing these terms around is getting a lot of people's portfolios (even you can even call them that) murdered.

&#x200B;

Diamond hands and paper hands are subjective terms. It's diamond hands when you boldly hold and pull out a big gain, but it's just autism when you boldly hold and go to zero. It's paper hands when you take a comfortable gain early, but the stock still keeps mooning, not when you sell a net positive on a sinking ship/something you didn't really believe in and just played for the momentum. This goes back to my previous post on the subject: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5gg38/you\_have\_to\_know\_when\_to\_pull\_out\_even\_if\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5gg38/you_have_to_know_when_to_pull_out_even_if_you/)

&#x200B;

I think people get these confused here. Real diamond hands is knowing you're on board the right ship even though people are temporarily getting off. Real paper hands is taking a gain way too early or selling emotionally off of one temporary piece of bad news, dip etc. But blindly throwing these terms around is getting people killed on here. It's making people lose their life savings in the blink of an eye. Why would you let the opinions of anonymous retards influence anything you do?

Shorts and bears bet big on this company  (Biocryst pharmaceuticals) hoping it would fail in 1-2 ways; not getting FDA approval, or having to dilute their shares in order to get more cash to keep operating.

**Shorts really fucked up though; because they didn't get just 1 wrong, they got both bets wrong and now 22% of the float on loan are trapped in short positions underwater.**  (the dumb bears/algo's have been trying to short in the mornings to trigger a selloff, but it's not going to work and it's just digging them in deeper.)

The bears really fucked up though, because not only did they get FDA approval for their drug, they got 325 million in non-dilutive funding.  They have \~ 475 million in cash access and a pill form for a medical condition which previously required people to self inject medications, it was awful but people did it to stay alive/safer.

Positions: 12/18 5C's, 12/18 10C   Get in before the mega squeeze begins!

**Since I was asked, I will actually do this.**

**I was already mulling over this market response and why it's been deemed bad news when it's really not...  Here's the reality here:  The leader of the NIAID and NIAIH (Dr. Fauci) changed the rules of clinical trials specifically for COVID treatments only after Remdesivir received ""full approval"" to where even Phase 1 trials were required to provide some form of ""efficacy.""  This is 100% a lobbyist/political change to impact the current or incoming president because people are stupid enough to believe a drug approved under 1 person vs another increases their status or image (real petty shit I know.)**

**Here's what the reality of what real clinical standards have long been established as (Table of phases below) and will likely revert back to (if their politically aligned person takes office or the lobbyist gets removed) once they get called out for this anti-scientific political bullshit being pressed into science we could maybe have this happen but it's unlikely.**

https://preview.redd.it/5dow87ryhy661.png?width=1592&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ed025ddc05078507f77a3d49157a135dfe33cbb

**As you can see above; Phase 1 has NEVER EVER BEEN A CHECK FOR EFFICACY, PERIOD.  There's just not enough people within the test group, 20-100, to provide any statistically meaningful results towards efficacy.**

**Even phase 2 trials are iffy as they only take a sample size of 100-200, it's a check on the dose ranging to determine if they are in the correct range or to change the dosing slightly for Phase 3 which is 300-3000 people.**

**Phase 3 is where the real efficacy check is, and is why it's the final check for all drugs coming to market.  The safety profile gets well established during this phase as they are more likely to include people with other health problems (unrelated to the treatment target/problem) into the trial pool as to better represent the real demographics of populations.**

**When this trial was changed to need to establish efficacy, obviously Phase 2/3 standards using only 20 people, it would never ever pass muster and will never happen.**

**Here's data and the example as to why:**

**Remdesivir's efficacy could not be established until data got cherry picked by the NIAIH/NIAID even though they had data on 10,000+ people from MULTIPLE Phase 2-3 studies on Remdesivir vs COVID performed early 2020.**

**The FDA used data on 1060 patients:  The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with Remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with Remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received Remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).** 

**What you see here is actually a very small % differential of ""efficacy"" and it's not good.  It's likely the worst data of ""improvements and efficacy"" to ever receive full approval since 2000 or maybe even dating back to the 80's and here's why...**

**Remdesivir's ""efficacy"" was 5.2% improvement in short duration treatment and 3.8% improvement for the longer term use.  Long term use should almost always show greater improvement but in this case it didn't.**

**If you want to be upset about the great information BCRX published which met every single standard of Phase 1 trial standards, don't be.  Instead look towards the lobbyist's of big pharma (Gilead) and the people changing the rules (NIAID/NIAIH director Dr. Fauci.)**  

**This unethical change of Phase 1 studies required to produce ""efficacy data"" on 20-100 patients is to prevent better therapeutics from coming to market for the treatment of COVID and we will likely see other drugs halted under this new anti-scientific political standard.**

**Sorry folks, this is our world, the leaders are all politically motivated and they really don't give a shit about saving people over public image of who they do and don't politically align with/like.**",2020-12-09 19:19:17

What is the latest news on Apple and the new AirPods Max? Should we buy AirBNB or DoorDash when they launch tomorrow? Let’s talk about this and more about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/8zQQ165) leading the way up half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9pFmQ0X) up .28%, both of them closing at new record highs with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/bbsbdqM) also up .35% to close Tuesday. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MPVyNn) also showed a steady decline through the day as it dropped almost 3%. This moves in the market were caused by the [latest](https://ibb.co/Lnr5Q3X) hopes for a stimulus deal to be agreed on by the end of current session in congress as there seems to be a lot of ground on which parties can agree on. Things have gotten worse in the economy since this hole stimulus talk has been going around, so, if both parties would have been more willing to give up some ground, people would have already gotten more support and we would probably be talking about other bills or measures that would have helped even more. So, maybe this [latest](https://ibb.co/w4LYBk9) Mnuchin proposal with maybe minor tweaks would be the best chance of anything happening by the end of this year.

We saw more companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/R9N61kK) as over 3 thousand companies were moving up, continuing the huge bull run started in November as more than 84% of companies are moving above the 50 and 200-day moving averages. The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/hLpbcrx) yesterday were Energy and Health Care while Real Estate and Utilities lagged behind as Large-Cap Growth companies were the only company factor [analysis](https://ibb.co/zbJd6m2) that lost ground yesterday, with small-caps, especially small-cap growth companies largely outperforming the markets.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hcMmt7x) that there were gains to be made yesterday in a lot of parts of the stock market, with only a few big red spots on the map.

[Today](https://ibb.co/RgSDj55) we will get some numbers on the November Job [openings](https://ibb.co/VLVz771), MBA mortgage applications and Petroleum inventories. 

While we got some earnings yesterday from Chewy which dazzled again in [earnings](https://ibb.co/Jd7Scx1) with the only small miss coming in net sales per customer, but as the number of customers keeps increasing, this might continue to go down, as not every pet owner spends the same amount of big money on pets. The company [reported](https://ibb.co/WVndSgJ) an EBITDA of $5.5M vs a loss of over $9M expected with the gross margin increasing to over 25% while also giving great [guidance](https://ibb.co/h8BPK2W) for Q4 of $1.94B to $1.96B vs less than $1.8B expected by analysts.

The company also turned around to a positive [cash flow](https://ibb.co/ys3NVTc) of over $30M. I really like this company and I expected it to be a good own at least for the next quarter until they reach more hard earnings comps next year.

Meanwhile, as I expected GameStop had another bad [quarter](https://ibb.co/DWP4jZh) despite beating some earnings estimates with a smaller loss than expected, the revenue still continued to drop over 30% on a year over year basis while comps where even worse missing the expectations by quite a margin. 

Though e-commerce sales rose by more than 250% in Q3, this did not offset the comparable store sales. Margins also declined with hardware margins being the biggest reasons why. I think this company has a very though challenge on its hands with e-commerce being such a though place to compete in, I think the shift to online has been delayed for this company and I think it will struggle to survive, even though it might see a boost next quarter from the sales of the new gaming consoles that were released last month from both Sony and Microsoft.  [GME EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS](https://ibb.co/SymxCtK)

I wouldn’t touch this [stock](https://ibb.co/K0cN5ds) as I think there are far better plays out there than betting on this struggling company.

The only company that I am interested today which will release earnings results is [ADOBE](https://ibb.co/d5SBbyX) which is expected to have the best results ever for the company with an increase of over 12% in both EPS and Revenues. Last go around despite posting great results, the stock fell more than 4% in September and have just recovered to that price point. I expect it this time to go higher and stay that way if they manage to deliver the best quarter on the books.

Meanwhile [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/FgJ5k7z) is pricing its initial public offering at over 100$/share which I believe is ridiculous, and it is an flat out joke of a valuation, this company has benefited a ton from this economy and still, this valuation implies that they will have over 50% of the total addressable market not in the US, but in the WORLD in the next couple of years, I don’t think this is a good investment opportunity, they will have increasing competition that offer the same thing for free or cheaper, this is a very though business to try and take over as one single company. People will also be way more likely to start going to restaurants maybe not in 2021 but for sure starting 2022 or whenever the vaccines are widely available in the entire world. I wouldn’t touch this stock at such high valuations, especially over 110$, even if I was looking for short-term gains which might end up being the case, I think there are better opportunities out there.

In contrast to DoorDash, I might be interested to buy some AirBNB if the price is right after the [IPO](https://ibb.co/RBDhWW0), I think it will have a much better future, as personally I really like to rent out apartments or homes whenever I go on a vacation rather than a traditional hotel. And even though it might have a tough Q4 and Q1 next year, I expect by Q2 next year more people will be vaccinated, so more people will start and go out and travel, and with especially low comps for next year as bookings are way down in 2020 this might make the company look much more attractive by this time next year. So, between DoorDash and AirBNB, I clearly like AirBNB a whole damn lot more.

In other IPO news, [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/WyJs5vQ) is expected to go public as soon as Q1 next year as they seek a valuation of over $20B.

Some other [Boeing](https://ibb.co/6rN04h6) came for companies like Boeing which made its first 737 MAX delivery since the ban ended, as it is expected to start rolling out deliveries and upgrades for current planes at a very good rate with more good news coming from the UK which will suspend the tariffs imposed on US Goods.

While [PENN](https://ibb.co/qJhKxGY) gaming ran to an all-time high yesterday after news that sports betting may be launched in Michigan as early as six weeks from now, as legalization of gambling is moving faster and faster in the US, this also bolds well for DraftKings and other gambling stocks.

Also, [ETSY](https://ibb.co/F0vsdmD) keeps getting upgrades from analysts as they are expected to have a great Q4 suggested from the most recent November sales data.

And finally let’s talk about Apple, as they just [revealed](https://ibb.co/dKrwT6j) the new AirPods Max headphone yesterday, with a huge price tag of 549$, this seemed to gain a pretty bad reaction from [consumers](https://ibb.co/CJ8DkLR) as [they](https://ibb.co/xz2HDXx) complained about the huge price tag with competitors like Bose and others selling similar headphones for 350$ or less. These headphones, also have a bigger price tag than even the new PS5 videogame console so we will have to wait and see if this is a successful product from Apple, I think they have gone a little overboard with the price, but rich people do tend to pay a premium for brand names. This can also be seen in the [latest](https://ibb.co/By3F6jS) analyst call from JPMorgan as customers appear to favor high end models as delivery times have been increasing for the 12 Pro and 12 PRO MAX. 

On the better side of things for Apple, the [Fitness+](https://ibb.co/Kh3KnQg) service is expected to launch on the 14th of December and it will cost $9.99/month or $79.99$/year. I expect this to be a better success for the company and to drive an even more stable increase of revenues, as subscription-based revenues are better than one-time sales. 

So, I still like this company the most in the long-term and it might see a spike in the near future, especially moving closer to Q4 results and earnings. Apple is still the biggest position in my portfolio and I am not planning on changing that anytime soon.

Good luck to everyone in the stock market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/q7rHvL5) are mixed while writing this post with the DOW and SP500 gaining ground while the Nasdaq futures are just down for the moment.

DD,PLTR at these Valuations,9,k9rivh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9rivh/pltr_at_these_valuations/,64,1607548043.0,"TL;DR: My admittedly slightly 🐻🌈 on PLTR at these prices. Sell puts at around 24 if you have no current position in underlying. Sell CC at around 30-33 if you do.

**My play on PLTR**

I'd really like to see a pullback to \~25 (or lower ideally) ... then I would load up on calls, shares, and sell a bunch of put credit spreads. I like PLTR, but I hate these valuations... it may be I don't know enough about the company, but I have friends who work with it in DC. The problem is that the software platform requires heavy customization for every client... this is a big scaling issue..and I cannot find any data on how PLTR plans to scale to justify valuations at the SNOW level (which is where this thing would need to go to be a huge money-maker at these prices).

**The major problems I see with PLTR are:**

* Highly dependent on govts. Palantir has to be careful with profits so that it doesn't reek of perceived abuse (irrespective of actual value). They risk inquiries, GAO (Government Audit Office) audits, downsizing, and potential cancellations depending on the internal pressure. I believe this is why they are angling for surveillance, etc as those contracts are less transparent by nature, which mitigates this challenge some
* Customizations - makes it tough to scale big time a la SNOW
* Lockup Period - there will be major downwards pressure on the stock when this ends mid-February. 

**The good:**

* Rockstar management and backing
* Super-compelling offering with what is to be the major problems at govts/corps (parsing signal from noise in the data due to data overload)
* Should be majorly profitable

**Summary**

I like PLTR. I am a bit wary at these prices, since it's tough to gauge if this is a pure SaaS or a consulting company. Given Thiel's involvement, and heavy insistence on platform plays, I am inclined for this to be the former. I'd like to see a bit of pullback first and IV to come down. In the meantime, selling weekly puts to take advantage of the sky high IV.

Any other insights? Anything I missed and should be added?

LAME! Look at the history of tech companies that disrupt industries, they have not only disrupted the Industry but dominated (amazon, google, visa,). AIRBNB is in, younger people do not even know a hotel companies name anymore. Back in the day when you came back from vacation saying a brand name hotel was a status display to your friends, now people look at you as a tech tard.  Everyone in my social circle and myself included has used AIRBNB in COVID to party. Its shown profitable quarters in the past which is rare for a new tech company. It also should not be mistaken with the likes of DOORDASH as that's a horrible run business. AIRBNB is the future. Honestly, I am gonna ride this to the moon, but it's far more than a meme stock.

This research was used in premarket approval for the catheter.

After Antik Bose was exposed as a false identity over 5 of his social profiles were deleted. The timing of this eliminates the possibility that the false identity was not created by Penumbra management.

The company did not issue a press release in response to the first report in response to deaths, but after Antik Bose was exposed, we received this little gem from the CEO:

“This attack by sleazy short sellers QCM reads like an internet conspiracy written by teenagers. It is impossible to dispute the facts, because there are no facts.” 

Why no press release on the first report in response to deaths, but they want to respond like this to the second report? This company is going to the shitter.

DD,TSLA S&P Purchase Chart - 73B in TSLA purchased around 12/18 - Where will it come from? Is it possible? At what cost?,98,k9ny73,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9ny73/tsla_sp_purchase_chart_73b_in_tsla_purchased/,101,1607530086.0,"All funds, ETFs, etc that directly track the S and P have to buy TSLA on or around the 18th. The majority will be purchased directly on the 18th. almost **15% of TSLA Float** will be bought on or around the 18th. Locking it up for as long as it is in the S and P.

**Can They Buy Enough TSLA on 12/18?**

When only counting S&P and tracking index funds / ETFs, at current Tesla Price, they are scheduled to purchase **$73 Billion in TSLA.**

This gets progressively larger, as the price increases.

[TSLA Price Changes Changes S and P inclusion purchasing](https://preview.redd.it/qsv4203674461.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deebe56d8351bcd988ac5698ae07ddf8c86b1d87)

They have to buy 113+ Million shares, or about **15% of all available shares.**

**How are they going to do it?**

1. **Institutional Investors - 52.96%** [Institutional investors](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=TSLA&subView=institutional) Hold 402M Shares
2. **ETFs - 4.6%** \- 35M Shares. These aren't for sale. Example QQQ owns 10M shares - [165 ETFs that control 17B of TSLA](https://www.etf.com/stock/TSLA)
3. **Retail Investors - 42.4% -** The rest I assume.

**What percent of this TSLA can actually be traded on or about the 18th?**

**ETFs can't sell** their shares, they are tracking something, they just can't sell TSLA.

I believe less then **20% of the retail investor shares will be available.** The rest are held by people that won't even log into an investment account on 12/18 or next week at all. Think of retirement funds, long term investors, etc.

This would mean that **64M** TSLA shares might be available for purchase from retail investors --if the price is right. I don't think these investors are going to liquidate at the current stock price. They are still holding for a reason.

Then there are institutional controlled shares, I believe that a lot of those shares are locked up, think of mutual funds, and investment groups. Baring an emergency they must have meetings and votes on what they trade. It takes weeks or months for many of them to divest in one area and invest in another. They aren't setup to switch strategies at a moments notice, especially for a stock that is having a rally. Also, Think of funds that are filled with just manufacturing or car companies, etc. They won't decide to exclude TSLA for a day / week / month because the price is too high.

Some of the institutional investors have had TSLA for a long time, they have already decided that they want to keep it, and aren't ready to part with it just because it has a high value.

Also look at Capital Group management and Vanguard Fund, together they control about 10% of TSLA (15% of float) and I'm assuming it is intermixed within many of their combined 170 mutual funds they control. I can't imagine that they can divest TSLA from most of the places they have it stashed on one day. Maybe they already have started, but I doubt it.

I think less then  **40%** of the institutional shares will be available on Dec 18th, I think this would be a very 'high' estimate. I also think that the price would have to be North of 750 for these people to think of liquidating. They have TSLA for a reason, and it has done very well for them, a lot of them sold some shares last quarter, and I bet they regret it now.

That would mean **161M** Shares might be available from Institutional Investors, if the price goes astronomical.

**225M Shares actually available on 12/18 (Based on my guesses) - THEY NEED 113M+ and the price will be sky high to get that number.**

I think that it would be very expensive to get 113M shares out of the grips of investors. I think there will be huge profit taking, but I don't think people are going to be willing to liquidate all of their positions. Sell off 10 - 20% sure, but 100% without a 2 -3X increase from the week before seems unlikely, remember, these are **TSLA HOLDERS, they have held for 700% increases this year.**

There is a speed that this has to be done at as well, Even if only 80% has to be done on the 18th, They have to buy **13.9M+ SHARES ( $9B @ 650) PER TRADING HOUR**, if they take an hour off to let the price slow down, they have to **double** it the next hour to keep up with the pace. 3 - 4pm when they are looking at how far they still have to go is going to be a ***B******lood Bath***. Yes some funds can invest a few days before, but it's a small percentage of them, and it still doesn't change the fact that between now and then 113M shares minimum need to be locked away.

Also, think of all the shares that are used as collateral on options. Writing Covered Calls, when the price surges, you probably don't want to liquidate your covered call and sell your shares. They are probably just going to stay tied up, after all, with selling a covered call, you don't benefit from the upward spike in price, your betting the stock will settle down and you get to keep the call premium. TSLA has had immense options activity, and you have to imagine with high Theta, there are a lot of people who enjoy writing covered calls now.

**Wildcard 1: Short sellers**, if there are any TSLA short sellers out there, and IF they can find shares to rent, that aren't sold on the 18th, they could sell short to cover what's needed. But as they watch the stock skyrocket, how willing are they going to be to write those shorts, and if they get liquidated later in the day from a margin call from a skyrocketing stock, those shares have to be replaced from the open market.

I am a little worried about holding 12/18 call debit spreads, I would be worried that they are going to execute the short end early on me to get the shares they need, and making a mess in my account.

**Wildcard 2: Options**, What happens if investment firms start buying options just to exercise them and get the shares? Naked Short Calls will be popped at the worst times, causing market orders to be placed and force buying all over the place. There will be margin calls that require short stocks to be covered, etc. I can see chaotic price increases. 

**Bullets Dodged on this crazy run:** I highly doubt that Tesla will offer another group of stock for sale before the 18th, I believe that this was a signal that this is the only offering they will be making in December, they don't have a history of selling new groups of shares every couple weeks.

The S&P declared that they didn't want to mess up their largest stock addition by doing it in stages. They want it all done on one day.

**Do they care about the price paid? Won't this hurt the S&P? Won't the people in charge refuse to pay the high price?** Not really, They manage an unimaginable amount of money. TSLA is going to make up 1-3% of the S&P, so if they have to overspend by 50-100%, that only effects the index by a percent or two.  The index dropping 2% - its called a Tuesday. TSLA on the short term doesn't effect the index much.

Their biggest concern is properly running the ETF / index. they have to stewardship the index properly.  Not buying at whatever the price is exactly how they announced it would be done weeks ago is the only thing that would hurt their jobs at this point. **THEY WILL BUY AT A FURY PACE ALL DAY. They just have to buy the right amount of shares.** 

**S and P Benchmarked Funds:** There are another **6.6T** in funds that are **Benchmarked** to the S and P, but they are actively traded, and they aren't going to be required to buy shares on the 18th. Some, are already buying shares, those shares will most likely be unavailable for the 18th. This could easily add another **25M - 50M more shares** to be purchased on or around 12/18.

**One last thing to consider:** Remember, There are long term investors all over the planet. Look at this study that says  [ Almost 1% of TSLA is held in S. Korea alone](https://observer.com/2020/08/tesla-stock-fueled-by-korea-retail-investor-apple-microsoft-amazon-tech/#:~:text=As%20of%20Friday%2C%20Korean%20retail,were%20first%20reported%20by%20Bloomberg). How much of that can come home to US indexes on 12/18?  They are asleep for our trading hours.

700C, 800C, 900C, 1000C 12/24

Hell, I'd buy some 1250C for .20 if some fool would write them. ($20 on a long shot of getting it sold at the right time for 2-40k profit)

Edit: My original post mistakenly included the 6.6T in index benchmarked funds to the total S and P tracked funds.",2020-12-09 11:08:06

I believe that PTON is the next 2014 GoPro. If you remember 2014 GoPro was trying to tout thembselves of as a tech company, a social media company, a brand of sorts, and more. I believe they were trying to tell people they were going to also be a drone company. Stonk was soaring. I remember thinking this is just a fucking camera company. All they make is a above average to low premium camera. Why are the large camera companies of the world not crushing them. Well turns out the company was actually valued at around 5 bucks eventually. I believe the same will happen to PTON. It may not go to 5 bucks but I believe it could definitely go to 30-40 dollas by the fibinachi bands. My take is boat loads of people are not going to purchase a 2-4k dollar bike that does not even move. This is during a pandemic where money is supposedly tight. They also have lots of people aggressively fighting for market share aka ... Nordictrack, Mirror thing, Apple, Plain old normal bikes.

I dont see them as a tech company or a social media company. I see them as a fad excercise equimpement. Half of going to the gym is actually going to the gym. Most people never work out as well at home. This bike will be ridden by my fat wife Becky for a few months then after that it will go in the corner. After a few more months I will trip over it and move it to the garage. After a few more months of pay the subsription I will cancel it. After a year or so my wife even fatter than before will now drag the bike out of the garage for a couple weeks and watch spin class from youtube on her ipad or phone. After a few months the bike will go back in the garage where it will stay for another few years.

&#x200B;

TLDR; PTON is the shakeweight of stonks. It is a meme in it self. It is what happens when you put 20in rims on your stationary bike and bolt on a 50in Plasma. There is only one direction for this rocket bike to go and that is down.

Still extremely bullish here and think we get an announcement for Phase 3 UK results within the next 5 trading days. Based on an improved version of my model, the UK trial should be well over 50 events by now, even if we assume 100% efficacy. I suspect management is waiting for the original 66 event threshold in the clinical trial protocol due to the massive increase in COVID cases in the UK. 

&#x200B;

Today's US Phase 3 trial announcement didn't generate much of a reaction but all vaccine stocks have traded down over the course of the day. The value in this announcement is that we know that the FDA has approved their manufacturing process and release testing assays, which takes away some downside risk. I suspect that the lukewarm response to the trial announcement may be due to the misconception that NVAX is much further behind than they really are bc of the failure to understand that the UK trial is what really matters. The US trial needs to be run to support eventual full approval in the US, but not for emergency use authorization and global licensure and that's what really matters. 

&#x200B;

I hoped the trial announcement today would have been a bigger catalyst, but this still all comes down to the UK interim update. If efficacy is >90% then this will take off. I haven't started rolling my Jan 15 calls and probably won't start unless we get to mid-week next week and we still don't have an update.

I continue to get questions about NVAX and decided to make one final post for current and prospective NVAX holders. For those who didn’t read my previous posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5464b/from_the_scientist_who_posted_the_nvax_dd_updates/)), I’m currently a biomedical PhD candidate and have >5yrs of experience in vaccine R&D.

&#x200B;

Due to several persistent misconceptions, NVAX is insanely undervalued and is poised to take off in the very near future due to the upcoming interim readout of their Phase 3 UK trial which will support global licensure.

&#x200B;

When I say that I think NVAX will take off, consider that it went from $90/share to over $140/share in 4 trading days on news about setbacks to AZN's trial, which is nothing compared to the impact of the upcoming interim readout.

&#x200B;

Based on \*current\* supply deals alone, NVAX is projected to supply more doses of their COVID vaccine to the world in 2021 than Pfizer and Moderna combined, yet NVAX sits at a market cap of $7.3B. For reference, MRNA and CVAC - two other companies with no marketed products - have market caps of $61B and $23B, respectively. Also consider that not only does CVAC have no marketed products, their COVID vaccine is still in Phase 2 (NVAX started Phase 3 in September) and their Phase 1 data looks weak (NVAX's Phase 1 data is arguably best to date).

&#x200B;

With the supply/distribution constraints for Pfizer and Moderna, I suspect NVAX will ink several additional agreements upon release of their Phase 3 interim data. Earlier today, Australia increased their [order](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-11/coronavirus-live-blog-december-11-covid-vaccine-trials/12972448) from 40M to 51M doses due to issues with an in-country vaccine.

&#x200B;

# If all of this is true why is NVAX's market cap so low?

I suspect that the *primary* reason for NVAX's low market cap is the misconception that NVAX is too far behind Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca to matter because their US Phase 3 trial hasn't started.

**The market doesn't seem to appreciate that they started a 15,000 person trial in the UK on September 24th which will support global licensure if successful** (my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) post outlined why I think the probability of success is extremely high)**.** Rarely do I see this mentioned in NYT, Bloomberg, or WSJ articles on COVID vaccine updates and as a result, I think NVAX is being incorrectly viewed as a longshot.

Although it's not definite, the UK trial will also likely be able to support a US EUA due using a trial design harmonized with US requirements. Regardless, the timing for the US market is not nearly as important due to the fact that their funding from Operation Warp Speed ($1.6B) guarantees purchase of 100M doses as long as a viable vaccine can be delivered. There are no stipulations that they need to be first to ensure purchase.

&#x200B;

# When will we get the interim readout and why is this important?

The UK trial originally had a planned interim readout at 66 events, but that's been moved up to 50 events due to anticipated high levels of efficacy (confirmed the validity of the screenshot in my last post). This means that once 50 people in the trial develop symptomatic COVID, they'll unblind and determine the percentage of people who received the vaccine versus the placebo. This type of readout is what supported the announcements made by Pfizer on 09Nov and by Moderna on 16Nov.

A positive interim readout (anything >90% effective) would be enormous because it would vault NVAX into the spotlight alongside PFE/MRNA. NVAX’s $7.3B market cap would quickly be in the rear view mirror. Full approval in the US would still require completion of a US based phase 3 trial (set to start imminently) but as I mentioned, US supply deal of 100M doses is already confirmed.

&#x200B;

Ok, so when will we get 50 events in the trial?

The official language used in company press releases says that the interim data are expected ""as soon as early first quarter 2021, although the timing depends on the overall COVID-19 rate in the region."" However, that was before they decided to change the threshold from 66 to 50 events. Also, their president of research also indicated in a meeting on November 24th that he thinks they'll get there before the end of the year because the trial is centered in several locations in the UK with extremely high rates of transmission.

Since I have >90% of my portfolio invested in NVAX options, I wanted to get some more confidence around the timing of when the trial would hit 50 events and put together a model to estimate a timeframe. Although this might seem like a ridiculous exercise, I actually think it's semi-reasonable due to the meticulous level of detail that the UK's Office of National Statistics [maintains](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata) regarding COVID infections and the daily modeled incidence rates they publish.

&#x200B;

# Going through the details of the model is probably overkill for WSB so skip to the end if you dont care. I’m including it so I can get feedback from anyone with a stats background

Using public statements about trial enrollment numbers, I assume three periods of linear enrollment from 24Sep to 27Oct (0 to 5500), 28Oct to 09Nov (5501 to 9000), 10Nov to 27Nov (9001 to 15000). Per the clinical trial protocol, events are eligible to be counted 7 days following the second injection. As a result, infections for participants injected on day 0 (24Sep) aren’t counted until 22Oct (1st shot + 21 days for 2nd shot + 7 days). Screenshot below should help to explain better if that's not clear. I also assume a 10% dropout rate, a 15% asymptomatic rate, and a 100% vaccine efficacy rate (this actually makes the projection more conservative).

&#x200B;

Because the probability of infection increases over time and there are different rates of infection on different days, I treat each row of the above table as an independent group to estimate the number infections over time based on the daily modeled infection rates. A screen shot of the table I used is below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9031712307e8052df3559e45397c313f47fc22

I divided each daily number by 10,000 to calculate an individual incidence rate per day and then used these daily incidents rates to determine cumulative incidence rates over different periods of time and then apply that to each group of participants in a rolling window. See below to get an idea of the calculation.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1c1bbb6940c5b65db7145c7cf4e236769548b4

The modelled incidence rates from ONS stop at 22Nov. For the dates beyond then and into the future, I duplicated numbers on the low end from the published period, which is probably more conservative than what we’ll see in reality. Another important difference is that the modeled incidence rates are for England (pop. 55M) but the trial is performed across the entire UK (pop 66M) which also makes the incidence rates more conservative. I’m ok with these factors being too conservative since the linear enrollment assumption is almost certainly too optimistic.

**With those caveats, my model estimates that the trial will accumulate 50 events between December 12th and December 20th.**

I think this is reasonable, however I don't have a statistics degree and am open feedback assuming anyone actually read all of this.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion and Final Predictions

We can debate NVAX’s management team and ability to deliver on manufacturing output, booster revenue, and a whole bunch of other things I addressed in previous posts but I’ll spare you bc none of it matters for what happens in the next 2-4 weeks.

The success of this trade will be based on 1) whether or not they announce positive interim results and 2) the timing of the announcement. If results are positive and they're announced in the ballpark of my estimated timeframe, then it could be an easy 500% return depending on the contracts you buy.

I wouldn’t be shocked if the stock dips a few more times prior to announcement in response to Pfizer/Moderna news, but I think we’re close to the bottom. I’m not comfortable missing an announcement so I’m not gonna bother trying to time it perfectly but keep that in mind.

I’ve settled in on a strategy of buying a few grand worth of OTM weeklies while building a core position of January 15th options on dips. Overall options volume isn’t great so I’ve been picking my strikes based on volume and have a ton of Jan 15 150c and 160c. See previous posts for proof.

If your risk tolerance isn’t high then regular shares aren’t a bad move because this is gonna move enough to still make good return and there’s potential for big swings until an announcement is made.

&#x200B;

**Final Predictions**

· Announcement of initiation of Phase 3 US trial between 11Dec and 18Dec

· 50 events recorded achieved between December 12-20; press release within 7 days of events being achieved (December 19-27)

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------

Update

Regarding options prices, consider the price history of the Jan 15 150c:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a89f8e974e0ebbcee444ded22c6e8fbe3fb942

That was due to a jump from $100/share to a high of $145/share. Interim announcement sends this much higher than $145/share.

DD,Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the next big play - PRPL part 2,21,kaskh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_next/,57,1607678759.0,"If you weren’t in Purple when it popped then you fucked up, and here is your next chance.

\*Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has options now… were added recently. Also has warrants.

THIS IS NOT A SPAC. HAS NOT BEEN A SPAC FOR OVER 2 YEARS.

(Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is a renewable energy construction company that has grown massively since its SPAC days in 2018. At the time the company was pulling about 460mm of revenue, and now has a back log of about 2bn +, while also becoming cash positive (last 2 quarters they posted positive eps, with the latest at .33 eps). EBITDA increased from 36mm to a whopping 125mm. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative currently trades at roughly 6x EV/EBITDA.

What does this all mean?

If you have been paying attention you would notice a lot of green energy companies have been flying. We are looking at insane valuations for certain companies which are all becoming overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is NOT overvalued and is in fact the opposite and WAY UNDERVALUED. This company has a market cap less than 260mm but pulls 2bn in revenue (and is currently profitable AND still growing). Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has a P/S of 0.13…. madness.

With Biden’s 2 TRILLION infrastructure plan, Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is poised to pull in more and more revenue while winning more contracts. In a few years this is a company that could potentially be pulling 8bn + revenue if they keep up the same level of growth since 2018. They also do civil work but 70% of their revenue comes from renewables. They are #1 in Wind and #12 (and growing) in solar nationwide. In their last CC they highlighted the fact that they will continue to focus on solar and are looking to cement more and more contracts in this area.

They currently sit at $11.35/share with the warrants at 1.53. Current market cap is about 250mm.

My short term target here is $20 per share, which is still under 500mm market cap… so even at $20 this is laughably undervalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative has a small float (around 23million OS) but heavy insider ownership so the tradeable float is actually a lot smaller, so this can move quickly with enough volume. I have been watching this and with only 1million in volume it has pumped 20-30% in a day. The ATH of mid-14s was just a few weeks back and the stock has slide since then (there has been no bad news… possible manipulation here). So at the very least, you SHOULD see around a 50% gain short term as Infrastructure and Energy Alternative should surpass recent ATH.

Infrastructure and Energy Alternative in comparison to other companies:

RUN: Has over 200m shares os and 10-13B MC, with only 875m annual Revs and 8.9m Net Profits. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative Revenues and profits are greater.

ROAD: 1.5bn Market cap (6x greater than Infrastructure and Energy Alternative market cap) and trades at x12 EV/EBITDA (double Infrastructure and Energy Alternative). These guys are a construction company as well… but focus on roads (obviously) and have nothing to do with the bullish green/renewables sector. Also less revenue than Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. ROAD eps is a bit higher though.

There is a looming 1bn massive solar project from Invenergy. No contract award has been announced yet but Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is definitely in the picture. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative HAS A HISTORY WITH INVENERGY. This is the largest solar project in USA history. If Invenergy chooses Infrastructure and Energy Alternative again for this project you best believe the stock is going to moon. I repeat, Invenergy and Infrastructure and Energy Alternative have a history of doing work with each other.

I like the warrants more that the commons, why?

Below is roughly what the warrants will trade at in comparison to the commons:

Commons – Warrants

11-13 – 1.50  
14 - 2  
15 – 2.50  
16 - 3  
17 – 3.50  
18 – 4  
19 – 4.50  
20 – 5  
21 – 5.50  
22 – 6  
23 – 6.50  
24 – 7  
25 – 7.50

A double from here in the commons (11s – 22s) is a 100% gain while $22 commons would result in roughly $6 warrants, so roughly a 300% gain from the current $1.50 warrants price. This is just short-term mind you.

Warrants cannot be called in by Infrastructure and Energy Alternative unless the commons trade over $24 for 20 out of 30 trading days. WARRANTS EXPIRE IN 3 YEARS. These warrants are like a 3 year call option….. even at $25 a share the market cap is still only around 500mm market cap.

The fundamentals here for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative are strong as fuck and you can play this in many ways: go long (set and forget) the commons, send it with options (options became available a few weeks ago!) and/or go with the warrants and possibly make fucking bank.

The bear case?

Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is a construction company. Margins are thin. BUT, revenue has grown by 4x in 4 years and is poised to continue growing. They have become cash positive in this time and profitable. There is no indication that this should change. All signs point to continued growth and improved margins. They have already stated the plan to pay down debt (around 300mm) so that alone will increase EPS and margins.

If you look at the historical chart. You will notice Infrastructure and Energy Alternative got hammered after it merged. This is because Infrastructure and Energy Alternative took on debt to buy civil construction companies to diversify its portfolio of renewable construction companies. There was also expressed interest by Oaktree and Ares wanting to buy the company out for under $6 a share and as a result the stock dwindled lower and lower. The buy out was rejected by the company and as it started to improve covid happened, again crushing the stock. Even when the company was “only” pulling 500mm in yearly rev, the price was undervalued, and now were sitting at 2bn revenue and growing.

Comparisons to PRPL situation:

Recently Infrastructure and Energy Alternative filed an S-3 shelf registration that hinted that up to $500m could be raised in a secondary offering to fund future growth and possibly to acquire more companies. Purple also had multiple secondary offerings. If you look at PRPL's growth from $8 to $16 to past $25, each rally was after a secondary offering of the founders reselling their existing shares to institutions. Secondary offerings are good for companies that are growing. They expand institutional support (which also creates support levels for the stock) and increases float so that daily volume goes up. Purple's offering was non-dilutive while Infrastructure and Energy Alternative offering might be dilutive. However, there are only 23m shares outstanding for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative right now. If Infrastructure and Energy Alternative had even 100m shares outstanding, a $20 stock price would be a $2B market cap, with revenues projected to exceed $2B in 2021.

Disclaimer: I am in the warrants and will be holding these for a while. My first target is at least $8/warrants. I think $10 warrants will happen here though (commons need to hit $30). PRPLW hit $30 commons and $10 warrants and im confident the same happens here.

**Context:**

Ya'll know how the software development life cycle works right? Alpha -> beta -> release candidate -> stable (overly simplified fyi). Red Hat Enterprise linux was sort of like the RC in that mix and CentOS was the stable. Stability is highly important and valuable to business everywhere.

**So the fuck what?**

What IBM has done this week is announce that instead of CentOS being the stable version, it will become the beta version. On top of that, the current version of CentOS (8) was promised to be supported to 2029. With this change, CentOS 8 will only be supported through 2021. 1 year to deal with this situation is just not enough time for many large organizations.

**What does this mean (aside from fuck watson)?**

This straight up means a fuck ton of companies are going to bail on CentOS and ostensibly, Red Hat altogether, to move to a more stable operating system such as Ubuntu Server.

edit *: Since you dingleberries can't understand the diffrence between the ticker name and the company name, i edited the post to state CNOOC instead of CEO 

CNOOC is the Company name, CEO is the ticker

**Background:** 

CNOOC is one of the big 3 state backed oil companies in China.

Oil companies took a dump and have been bleeding since the March crash, but since the announcement of the vaccine last month, almost all of them have pumped up about 30% and are continuing to recover. The recovery should continue with oil demand coming back over the course of the year. Although, oil it self will hopefully get phased out over the next decade or so, it's ridiculous to think these energy giants are going away. 

**What happened:**

CNOOC was following along with the rest of the oil giants and was up 30% in the last month until, unexpectedly, the administration black-listed CNOOC as one of the companies that has ties to the Chinese military. The price went from $120 to $85.

Trump’s own executive order is vague and lacks any real directive, so the implications are not completely known.
Regardless, the sell off is an extreme over reaction.

**Playing geo-politics:**

* Trump plans to add an additional 89 companies to the blacklist as a part of cementing his legacy of being “tough” on China. Like most things with Trump, it is unclear what exactly that would mean outside of these companies being delisted from US exchanges in about a years’ time

* The key thing to note here is that China is not retaliating in its typical fashion. This is because I believe they are confident most of this will be reversed or watered down by the Biden administration. Biden has a history of trying to “work” with China rather than being confrontational.  

* Oil companies have a huge lobby in America and will do everything in their power to prevent political obstacles. If Biden upholds the order, especially it being against a single Chinese oil company, it may prompt China to retaliate, which will force the US oil giants to put pressure on Biden. Also keep in mind a key point, CNOOC works with American oil companies such as Exxon. The more you think about how ridiculous this is, the less it makes sense 

* For Trump, this executive order is to pressure the incoming Biden admin into a corner and make them look weak against China when they eventually try to scale back the ""crackdown"". There is a likelihood that Biden may not all together reverse the order, but instead water it down. In that case, I'm confident that at the very least he will remove the companies that don't actually fall under the intent of the order. Which is to black list companies that produce/manufacture Chinese military equipment. 

**Some Numbers:**

There isn't much to put here that you can't figure it with a quick google search, in general, CNOOC is criminally undervalued. 

CNOOC current P/E ratio is around 6.8, this is at an all time historical low while the industry average is about double that (12.5). This is reason enough to buy in. 

$85 has support and it bounced off that yesterday, this is a positive sign that it will stay above that price for the foreseeable future.  It has been more than a week since the announcement, and I believe we are at the bottom now with enough bleed out.

**The play:**

Now is the time to buy in before the market starts pricing in the Biden transition. It’s only a matter of time before it becomes clear that Biden doesn’t plan on upholding Trump’s executive orders, at least not for this company as it has little do with Chinese military.

You can pick up shares as the safe option, especially because this has a high dividend payout, or you can pick up some longer dated options. I have personally picked up 95c 3/19. The spreads are large, so try to get something reasonable, premiums are not that expensive. 

**TLDR** – Get on that China Oil recovery, 95c 3/19 CNOOC",2020-12-11 00:02:16

Clients pay a monthly fee in a standard SaaS model, with fees for other optional services like featured posts or listing priority on WMH’s Weedmaps marketplace.

While the recurring revenue from the enterprise software provides solid value, Weedmaps is where the real opportunity lies.

Weedmaps is WMH’s ecommerce platform and listing marketplace that shows customers nearby cannabis businesses. Customers can order packaged cannabis products or deliveries from local dispensaries through the app, as well as leave reviews.

In essence, this makes Weedmaps both an Amazon and DoorDash for cannabis, and amazingly WMH does not currently charge a commission on most transactions on the Weedmaps platform.

Arrival's shareholders (Insiders, Hyundai, Kia, Blackrock and UPS) have already voted in favor of the merger with CIIC.  
They expect the ticker to change some time in Q1.  


UPS currently has 10 000 vans on order and the timeline for Arrival to begin deliveries is Q4 2021.  


CIIC has already rocketed up over 30$/share.

The Warrants however are at a steep discount, with a breakeven of 18.50 per share at the current price. Assuming shares stay flat, potential profit come the merger is just over 12.50 per share. (179% gain). To start losing money, shares would need to drop 40% from here. This literally can't go Tits up.  


TLDR: Buy $CIICW instead of $CIIC for a potential 179% gain with 40% downside protection.

OK. Let's do some DD before sinking more money on this. (sources explicitly named)

&#x200B;

**Sheep**

* Nasdaq: 15 recommend a Strong Buy
* Nasdaq: Average price target: $277
* Yahoo: 16/45 recommend a Strong Buy
* Yahoo: 25/45 recommend a Buy
* Yahoo: Average price target: $275
* Morningstar target: $253. Hold
* CFRA target $309. Strong buy
* Thomson Reuters target: $275. Buy
* Market Edge target: $260. Avoid (fuk'em)
* Wallstreetbets target: moon. Less hate than Slack so far

&#x200B;

All things indicate a strong analyst interest and higher valuations. It's not a meme stock (yet?).

&#x200B;

**Crayons**

* Short term support: $188
* Short term resistance: $247
* RSI: near oversold
* MACD: no idea, but it could reverse soon

&#x200B;

Not worth showing questionable charts, you can do your own. I loosely use RSI and MACD to help inform my trades; they both show promise.

&#x200B;

**Propaganda**

Bloomberg just reported that people have stopped returning to the office. The WFH shift is becoming more prevalent as time goes by. People will find new freedom and better quality of life. This continues to be good news for Salesforce+Slack.

&#x200B;

Morgan Stanley upgraded Slack. It says the deal is at full valuation. The deal is expected to close by July 31, 2021.

&#x200B;

Salesforce sets a new long-term sales target at its annual investor day. It now aims to reach more than $50B in revenue in FY26 -- up from a pre-M&A target of up to $35B for FY24. Sales for FY20 at $17B. 

&#x200B;

It looks like CRM will more than double it's value within 5 years. 

&#x200B;

**Shopping**

* Tableau. $15.7B. Data visualization
* MuleSoft. $6.5B. Integration software
* Demandware. $2.8B. E-Commerce
* ExactTarget. $2.5B. Marketing cloud
* Click. $1.3B. Field service management

&#x200B;

The general consensus is that Benioff has been a smart buyer. CRM's stock performance demonstrate it. Have you heard about a Salesforce M&A blunder (à la Time Warner/AOL, SAP/Qualtrics, Amazon/Whole Foods)? Exactly.

&#x200B;

BTW, Microsoft may have helped Benioff to get Slack for cheap. WORK was a pandemic stock with a solid product and real revenue, and still, they managed to miss the insane valuations that others got due to Microsoft's hard reaction (scared?) and frankly bad PR from Slack. 

&#x200B;

**Now What?**

What do I know. But all future indicators and past performance point to major tendies. CRM price targets paint a great story for 2021. Salesforce was in a major upward trend before the Slack acquisition announcement. Benioff has demonstrated to be a great dealmaker. The Slack acquisition reinforces Salesforce's intention to dominate the enterprise software landscape.

&#x200B;

You know that ""stonks only go up"", but did you know that Salesforce is part of the Dow as of Aug 2020 and belongs to the S&P 500? Who do you think will prop the them up going forward? You got it right, Sales fucking force dot com.

&#x200B;

TD;LR: Not gonna tell you what to do, but I have 250 CRM and 500 WORK shares. 5x 1/08 $225C, and 1x 12/18 $230C. Planning to load up on calls once the upward trend becomes clear (to avoid getting wiped out, yes I'm being conservative, but my Slack play paid out well).

&#x200B;

Whatever you do, please be careful with way OTM calls and short expiration. A lot of people were burned by WORK because of that. Salesforce is a $200B company that is not a meme stock; for options, it moves slowly until it doesn't.

Most of you guys just stick to losing money in GME and other crap. 

For the few smart people still here, I think I have a play that may pay very well. FDX (FedEx) is looking like it is primed for a strong run up to ER next Thursday now. It has sold off hard the past two days after two recent price target raises, but has bounced back hard from identical sell offs this past month. It has crushed both of the last ER and has been on a solid trajectory upwards the past few months. It is currently rated a better buy than UPS by most. 

I will be playing this run up to ER. I bought in a little early, but I will likely be holding through next Thursday then selling before earnings. I think this should likely hit 305-310 before next Thursday based on previous price action and the highs it hit earlier this week.

Discussion,"1.65m potential loss on a ""sure thing"" trade",964,kakcx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakcx7/165m_potential_loss_on_a_sure_thing_trade/,195,1607652128.0,"Guys, I'm posting this not to make fun of u/kumurule but to show how a trade can fuck you quickly and you won't be able to fix it without having insane amounts of cash to put out.

Yesterday kumurule [posted screenshots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9x7tz/get_rich_with_this_strategymin_profit_of_600_and/)  of 300 put spreads and 300 call spreads on the same underlying. QS trading at around $73 right now, he sold 300 -75/45 put contracts and 300 -50/75 call contracts. 600 credit spreads total. 

Some quick math: 

* \-75/45 put spread is $30 wide, so that represents a 3k max loss on the spread, multiplied by 300 = 900k loss then subtract the credit received ($2300 x 300 = $690k) for a **max loss of $210,000 on the put side alone.** And it's already ITM.

* \-50/75 call spread is $25, meaning a $2500 risk per contract, x300 contracts = 750k - premium ($390k) for a **max loss of 360k** on the call side.
* **Overall max loss of $570,000** 

Now you'd think that he can only get fucked on one side of this, right? Actually...

Since both his call spreads and put spreads are  ITM (in the money) and at risk of assignment, it creates a domino effect of losses if any one contract is assigned, (which happens often when something is deep ITM). 

Let's look at what one executed call contract would do:

* Someone decides to execute their 50 call and kumurule is now short 100 shares of QS because his long call is not ITM. There's currently a $23 difference between his short strike and the current market price. **That's $2300 because each contract represents 100 shares.** 
* If he doesn't have $2300/contract to pay that loss, then RH will close his positions to cover the loss even though they're barely profitable. **So he's no longer protected by his put side as they will be closed early.** 

Now let's look at his put side:

* His put side isn't deep ITM so the risk of early assignment is lower since he has January expiration. It's also an uptrending stock. But, if it goes up, his puts are closed early to cover so he's fucked. If it goes down, his call side will show profit, but again, people likely will execute their deep ITM calls when they see QS dropping to realize profit quickly.  
* I'm actually less concerned about the put side because 1) it's not deep ITM and 2) the stock is uptrending. 
* If kumurule can close all his calls, he *may* be able to wait out the stock, and on expiration day, if it's still ITM, he can roll out farther and possibly change it to a -70/40p spread and hope the stock has enough time to recover.
* **but** I don't think he will be able to do that because of assignments on the call side that will hit him left and right and he will probably end up with his account frozen unless he ponies up large amounts of cash to cover.
(update: he woke up to his account already being frozen today)

Wanna know what happens when RH freezes your account? You have to fucking *email them* so they manually close your positions. So if QS drops to 69 and suddenly his call spreads are profitable, he better hope it stays that low while RH slowly checks their email and executes the trade for him. 

Ya'll better pray this stock tanks today so he can exit the call side and then he can manage the put side because otherwise, this is going to be a 6 figure loss. 

**Best case scenario:**

The absolute best-case scenario for this trade would be that QS tanks today (but the contracts aren't executed) and he's able to close all calls. That would leave him with put spreads that aren't deep ITM and probably won't be assigned early. 

If that happens, he can always roll his put spreads out and down and wait for the stock to catch up to his short strike and eventually realize the profit from the put spreads to mitigate the call losses.

**Worst case scenario:**

Domino effect happens, he's getting margin calls left and right, RH will close for him, he won't have a chance for the put side to make a profit and he will end up with **at least a 5 figure loss. Op is already at a $250,000 loss.**

**GUYS IF IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN LOSE AND IT'S A BIG PREMIUM YOU'RE RECEIVING, I PROMISE, THERE ARE VERY BIG WAYS TO LOSE.**

edit: hey sorry guys, I forgot to account for the premium received when totalling his potential loss. It's fixed now. Max loss is 570k after subtracting the premium. He’s currently at a 250k loss. 

edit 2: 

Robinhood reps were surprisingly really helpful and **aren’t liquidating his account.** They’re helping him scale out of the call side and leaving his put side alone. 

They gave him a direct line to a rep that’s helping him exit the trade with the least damage possible.",2020-12-10 21:02:08
DD,Get in on the next LAZR before it pops (DM just went public this morning),21,kak3yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kak3yk/get_in_on_the_next_lazr_before_it_pops_dm_just/,77,1607651440.0,"If anyone has been paying any attention to the stock market's biggest gains over the past two weeks they would see companies heavily meme'd and now well known (PLTR, LAZR, etc). However, trying to get into any of those now is at worst going to lose you money and at best net you much smaller gains than the trailblazers who already sold for massive profit.

If any of you are interested in what could be the next big play to jump like GMHI did after flipping to LAZR, take a look at Desktop Metals ($DM), formerly TRNE. In a deal much like the LAZR launch, Desktop Materials went public with the support of TRNE, and as such the TRNE ticker flipped just this morning to DM. The DM CEO rang the opening bell, had an interview on CNBC, and is now probably enjoying his afternoon with hookers and blow after a killer morning. Additionally, TRNE is one of the SPACs that Chamath Palihapitiya leads, and anyone familiar with him will know how good he's been at getting these things right. 

The TRNE underlying has increased almost 50% in the last week and over 115% in the past month, but the reasoning behind why this play is still wide open is that it's been behaving very similarly to LAZR. Leading up to the ticker flip for GHMI/LAZR, the underlying jumped a huge amount to the 20s, but then stagnated the day the ticker actually flipped. However, that same day it jumped EOD and then continued to moon into the 40s, before eventually settling to where it is now (note: I'm not saying the stock is done moving in either direction, but it certainly isn't making moves like it was last week). 

TRNE, now DM, has performed very similarly for a few days now, it dips in the morning, hovers around -5% midday, then jumps EOD. Now with national media coverage and the offical public ticker flip to DM, should it jump EOD today, that might be the catalyst for a similar sky rocketing like we all saw with LAZR. Additionally, the risk is relatively low as far as SPAC mergers go since the deal has already gone through and the ticker has already flipped, so should this not moon, it likely won't correct down to $10/share, instead any downwards movement will likely be limited.

The company has an 2.5b valuation with a current $850 million market cap, and has customers and backers such as Toyota, Honda, GE, etc. This is a more solid SPAC play than the likes of NKLA, and they have the tech and history to prove it.

One main concern is that both the technology and the name aren't as flashy and meme-able as LAZR, but the company itself is actually much more solid and more likely to be a good long term play. While no degenerate here cares about long term, boomers do. If this starts jumping, expect boomer fomo to take it to the moon or even Mars.

TL;DR
TRNE ticker flipped to DM, behavior and backstory very similar to GHMI to LAZR, we all know what happened there, get in before this stock hits $40 per share ($22/share as of this post)

Ur calls need to be delta hedged anyways. Borrow rate on IBKR right now is 80%. Are any of you getting 80% for ur shares? Well someone fucking is. 

I think IBKR splits borrow fees with you if you opt in but for the rest of us smucks there is

1. no way to keep people from borrowing ur shares. even setting a high limit order or whatever ur brokerages are happy to let ur shares be borrowed out
2. the only people benefitting are our fuck ass brokers that get to lend out our shares and RN they're making 80% while our shit chops back and forth and back and forth

I still have shares coz I'm basically all in on this play and having some amount of shares is the only thing that's going to keep me solvent if this play goes south, also I want to take advantage of any afterhours absurd action if some news breaks after hours or whatever but I'm really not trying to ""hold"" shares just so my fuck ass broker can be making 80% off of me

DD,Buy the inevitable $PTON dip today after vaccine approval news,18,kaiogq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaiogq/buy_the_inevitable_pton_dip_today_after_vaccine/,34,1607647287.0,"I will keep this as short as possible.

Vaccine approval news will cause a dip in the stocks that benefited from COVID-19. PTON is also suffering from news that Apple will release Fitness+. Lastly, PTON has had recalls and delivery delays, there will be some Christmas cancelations. Expect PTON stocks to suffer temporary dips. PTON has been dipping to ~109-112 past few days, I can see it going down even lower than that after this week. Buy this dip.

1. Vaccine news =/= COVID disappearing. We're going to suffer at least 4-5 long, cold months, and we're reaching record-breaking daily COVID deaths. People are shutting down, more lockdowns coming. PTON is due for a huge January bounceback. 
2. Fitness+ is compatible with Nautilus Octane which is an inferior bike to Peloton in every way and has a higher subscription cost. Plus the 1,000,000+ people who paid 2k+ for a Peloton aren't going to switch to Fitness+. Their content is not going to match Peloton's for quite a while, they're too new to this game and the Peloton userbase is loyal, 94% positive feedback from owners.
3. New Year's resolutioners will be buying this shit up in January as the weather gets cold and the gyms close back up. Peloton didn't release any stupid commercials this year, they've learned their lesson.
4. ARK Investments bought 200k shares a few days ago. I trust Cathie Wood. Analysts everywhere are upgrading their price targets, not downgrading. 
5. A close above 109.53 should setup 116-118 tomorrow: https://i.imgur.com/FiAW3xf.png

tl;dr: Buy PTON dip, this stock is a rollercoaster so the floor is going to be hard to find, but you can be confident of a rise in January, I expect 125 EOY, 140 by February.

My current position is 115c 2/19/21, waiting for the dip and I will buy some 120c.

Also, tread lightly with stocks because once the vaccine is here and the weather is nice, I don't see this as a long-term investment.

Edit: Didn't realize the hearing went until 5-6pm, keep an eye on the stock tomorrow.",2020-12-10 19:41:27

I write to remind you of an old friend of the sub, Mr. Satya Nutella.   

MSFT has been sideways ever since they tried to acquire a clock company, but MSFT is still MSFT, and azure is still azure. ER will be late Jan/early Feb, and IV is low rn.  

Post-ER ATM Jan MSFT calls have IV around 30%, w/ break even around $220. IV on LEAPS is also low.  I'm thinking there might be IV expansion heading into earnings, if the whole market goes up MSFT could just ride the wave, or third MSFT just bounces around alot btw 205-215 and if it randomly rises then cool. AFAIK opportunities for downside are basically a market crash/tech dip or random unexpected bad news for MSFT, which is just true for everything. For comparison on IV pre earnings in the current market, I'm looking at something like Oracle, a huge boring company that has ER tonight and IV on ATM options of 110%. Maybe there's some unique reason Oracle has high IV, but I don't know it.

AI is used for making more accurate predictions. If you can make more accurate predictions, you can fucking mint money. What if you could automatically know how much to price a airline ticket to sell out every single time, down to a penny. How about know exactly how many pairs of size 6 leggings you need to make this quarter down to within 0.25%. How about exactly what ads to show someone to maximize dollars spent on Instagram every year. This is what is happening billions times a day behind the scenes. 

&#x200B;

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) brings the power that has brought AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, and FB to the rest of enterprise. AI models are difficult to deploy, tweak, and manage. This shit is brand new, there is very little talent. [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) helps companies implement AI into their business through their full featured platform. 

&#x200B;

When you are looking for good software you want to find something that is defensible / complex, yet easy to implement, and obviously valuable to the end user. The reason ServiceNow can charge JP Morgan 60 million dollars a year is because it saves them 500. For C3, deploying these models is easy because they have pre-builts that they can adapt to any business, a platform to run them on, is cloud agnostic, and the internal talent that even medium organizations wouldn't be able to find / use effectively. A single AI implementation can be worth 10s, 100s of millions of dollars to an organization, and you don't think they will be happy to pay [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) through the nose to maintain it? AI capability will be table stakes in 2 years, if it isn't already. This is a pure-play on that. Look at the post IPO pop. Its time to go moon hunting boys.",2020-12-10 18:58:48

Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco & more. Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.

We saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.

We saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.

Today we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.

Alongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.

One good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.

Investors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still… there is to much of a concentration in the bull’s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.

Positive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they’re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.

While on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.

So, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino’s and many others from the food industry.

And by the way, don’t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.

One of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.

With the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can’t get enough of this stock’s, I don’t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.

Today we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don’t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.

Some other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don’t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.

While [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.

Also, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.

I expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it’s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.

Likewise, [Dave & Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren’t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.

While [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.

Adobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?

So, guys, don’t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).

Investors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.

Just be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP & UP.

Discussion,Canoo Has B2B Orders,26,kaf5tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaf5tq/canoo_has_b2b_orders/,38,1607635297.0,"This is all **speculation** so please don't take it as investment advice, insider information, or anything else ya jackaloons! 

Everyone has seen the BANGBUS! Its not pretty! In many interviews the Canoo team has been asked about ""consumer reaction to the design"" and they have all had to play defense and offense. Which is not fun for them at all. So why not introduce a slick sedan or pick up so it gets the **normies** (losers) on board before the B2B delivery van? It would be easy for them to do, it would create massive hype, and get the boomers on board.

I believe that they are pushing through with the B2B van before the B2C sedan/truck/suv because they already have a large partner that has made a big enough order for their vans to make them focus on the B2B sector. It is not easy for a company to focus on both, B2C and B2B... it requires a ton of resources and investment. A company doesn't make this pivot without a big partner to pump cash. When you try to focus on B2C and B2B, you immediately, at least double your competitors. Many much larger than you that want your head. You don't do this unless you have the partner and orders already in place. I think we see this announcement in Q1.

Who is the partner? **No idea.** It could be one of the big players in delivery such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, and even USPS. It could also be one of the big players in eCommerce that are building their own direct to consumer delivery network such as Amazon, Walmart, or Target. 

This post is **pure speculation** that Canoo/Hennessy/GoEV already has B2B last mile delivery orders for the van they are unavailing December 17th. 

Positions because I know ya will ask: Stock/Warrants or $20c 5/21

DD,EVRI: A Gambling Ticker That's Going to Valhalla,44,kacu7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kacu7p/evri_a_gambling_ticker_thats_going_to_valhalla/,38,1607623657.0,"**EVRI: The True Autists Gambling Ticker**

Alright dipshits, I believe I have found a ticker that has huge growth potential over the next few months that is under the radar of many. So prepare your smooth brains and tell your wife's boyfriend to leave the room so you can jerk off to these potential gains.

**EVRI** is Everi Holdings Inc. Don’t know what that is? They’re only *“the casino industry’s only single source provider of robust payments solutions, vital intelligence offerings, and engaging gaming machines that power the casino floor”* according to Casino Vendors

(Source: [http://www.casinovendors.com/vendor/everi-holdings-inc/](http://www.casinovendors.com/vendor/everi-holdings-inc/))

*Now if that doesn’t make your wife’s boyfriend cream his jeans*, then the following information might just make your dick hard enough to satisfy your displeasured wife. I think that EVRI could see huge growth for the following reasons

**EVRI has the versatility both online and on the floor for casinos**

Taking a look at this source ([http://www.casinovendors.com/vendor/everi-holdings-inc/](http://www.casinovendors.com/vendor/everi-holdings-inc/)) you can see that there products and services include…

1. Gaming equipment and supplies: “Everi Games feature exciting original concepts, dynamic artwork, and thrilling game play that are designed to stop patrons in their tracks. Players seek out Everi’s award-winning games, cabinets, and toppers, and stream into casinos to play TournEvent® and TournEvent of Champions®”
2. Cash/Chips/Money/Money Handling Equipment: “CashClub® gives operators an easy-to-use single dashboard interface that streamlines check warranties and credit/debit card transaction processing.

Based off of these services alone, any one of you extra-chromosomes gamblers can see why EVRI is able to make money both online and on the floor, physical casinos. They make online gambling games, provide systems to protect casinos, design on the floor games, have products to transfer money in and out of debit/credit cards at the casino to feed the gambler, and even have business in reporting casino data and marketing campaigns. IF THIS ISN'T A COMPANY THAT DOESN'T DO EVERYTHING THEN IDK WHAT TO TELL YOUR SMOOTH BRAIN. They are immune to COVID and can be profitable with/without it.

**EVRI has great target prices from analysts and even has potential news coming up that can propel us Valhalla**

[https://www.casino.org/news/everi-soars-on-digital-wallet-deal-with-winstar-casino/](https://www.casino.org/news/everi-soars-on-digital-wallet-deal-with-winstar-casino/)

“But Roth Capital analyst David Bain previously said two agreements with tribal operators notched by Everi account for 15 percent of the company’s fintech business and were going overlooked by investors.” This made the price target shift from $20 to $21 for this guy.

This same article said this about David Bain as well “Today’s surge by Everi stock may not be a one-off event. *Bain, the Roth Capital analyst, says another customer will roll out CashClub Wallet in the coming weeks.* He didn’t identify that operator, but *he did say it’s one of the largest casino firms in the world*. The analyst adds that on a standalone basis, Everi’s fintech basis is worth $16 a share. *When accounting for peer average multiples on gaming device suppliers,* ***the stock could trade near $29, or more than double where it resides today.”***

I know some you have a hard time reading, but that means we could see news of EVRI’s own product (CashClub) be announced to be integrated in one of the largest casinos companies in the world. If that doesn’t scream PUMP, I don't know what does

**EVRI also has fantastic news of expanding, incorporating, and even being recognized as the best in their field**

**EVRI’s option chain are cheap for long dated calls**

Because I am writing this after hours, the options chain will most likely change come market open, but keep in mind, they will still be cheap.

Looking at January 20c and March 22.5c, they are .18 with a .05-.3 bid/spread and .2-.25.

Yeah yeah yeah, I know what you’re thinking “oH tHE BiD aSK SpREad is TOO wIdE”. But if you guys seriously think the bid/ask spread is what has limited your autistic trades up to this point, then you’re just lying to yourself. Get your order filled, because were making fucking tendies.

**THE MEME POTENTIAL OF THIS STOCK IS PERFECT FOR US RETARDS**

*Is there anything that is more ironic than a bunch of degenerate gamblers gambling on a gambling company that is so revered in the gambling industry that it’s not even a gamble?* FUCK NO THERE’S NOT.

WE ARE MADE FOR THIS TICKER, AND AS AUTISTS AND GAMBLERS WE NEED THIS PLAY. As many of you know, once a ticker catches fire in this sub it gets HUGE coverage. Look for yourselves at the countless memes and videos of WSB getting coverage on Cramers shows and news outlets. MEMES MEAN MORE ADVERTISING, MEANS MORE PUMPS, MEANS MORE TENDIES, WHICH MEANS MORE MONEY FOR DICK PUMPS.

I rest my case.

TLDR; EVRi is a fucking powerhouse in the online/in-person gambling/casino world. They have lots of news going for them along with having cheap calls, a well run business with great price targets, good price action movement, and most importantly infinite meme potential

I’m (like all of you) bullish on $PLTR and thinking about writing puts, probably 1/21/22 $20p especially because I believe $PLTR is getting close to the bottom if its dip right now. 

My knowledge of the process: so long as $PLTR is above $20/share on 1/21/22, then I just collect my premium and all is well. If I get assigned, I’d love to own 100 shares at $20/each anyway and I have the cash, so that’s fine. 

The thing is, I really don’t understand the benefit/detriment of targeting a lower/higher strike. Should I go for something like 1/21/22 $15p so I get a better deal in the event of assignment even though my premium would be lower? Or does $20p make more sense? Should I write the puts for sooner than 1/21/22? I’ve tried googling but can’t seem to find a good answer.",2020-12-10 10:31:36

I wanted to do a bit of DD on BFT but also wanted to highlight something that was brought to my attention by a degenerate gambler. Lastly, I wanted to compile some good little snippets that have been put together by some other members as well as from the investor presentation.

**Before reading further please understand the major Risks.**

* This is SPAC with \~10.00 NAV, if the deal falls through it could drop to 10.00 USD
* The warrants could be very lucrative but they can be called and if a deal fails to materialize, these can become worthless.
* If you're ok with the above risks, continue reading.

Keep in mind that this merger is not complete, but the terms of the deal have been provided to investors and we will be able to either vote yes for the deal or vote no and redeem our shares in BFT for 10.00 cash. So there is downside to this play should the vote not go through or should the two entities terminate the agreement. Right now the downside is \~3 dollars per share according to the close price from today.

# The Customers and MOAT

* Deep Customer Base with deep ties to gambling/betting industry with Deep penetration in Europe and growing customer bases around the world. Gambling is a tricky business and regulated differently than other industries. Many big players have avoided the industry and Paysafe has a great reputation and has become one of the early movers in the industry. The following are some notable customers.

* A gentleman u/dancinadventures posted this comment on my last post:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *I actually know Paysafe and the usage quite well.*

*PayPal has many restrictions in Europe regarding iGaming , so does Square.*

*This is a big play on iGaming for those that aren’t aware.*

*I was a mid- high stakes online poker player through the 2010-2018. Played a variety of sites. : iPoker; PokerStars, Paddy, MicroGaming, 888, Party. Why so many sites? Because I was always on lookout for where the action was, if a big whale sat down at one online casino; you bet your sweet ass I’m there.*

*So let me give you my take as a consumer that’s probably spent over $100,000 in transaction fees personally on Paysafe.*

*This was one of the cheapest and fastest ways to move money around online.*

*Unlike Stripe this which is against risky business such as CBD and gambling, paysafe is actually one of the leading payment providers in both UK/AUS / Ireland for iGaming.*

*Big example is William Hill, Bet365, Bwin.*

*Now why would you want to move money online around as a gambler ?*

*Well, Visa/MC charge close to 50%->75% more, online casinos = the merchant. They don’t wanna pay that, and in fact put limits on this type of payment processor. (Your visa’s credit cards etc). If a punter deposits / withdraws frequently, the online casino could literally be on the hook for like 20-30% of the turnover throughout the gambler’s period. (This assumes the gambler doesn’t lose all his money per deposit.*

*Imagine you’re a professional sportsbettor, you’re not loyal to one site. Different spreads / odds are offered on every site, you want to be able to move your money from one to another quickly and cheaply. Arbitrage opportunities do exist in sports betting as bookmakers hedge their books to minimize risk, diff frequencies of bets occur on each sports book; you get the idea.*

*For recreational punters, it’s simple: some sporting events that are smaller simply don’t exist on one site that exist on another. Eg. Perhaps you using Pinnacle / 10dimes for low spreads on high volume events, but perhaps you want to gamble on live events on bet365 on another day, and bet ponies on Hill.*

*What if you only have $5000 ? Giant pain in ass to deposit money to each site, paysafe lets you move it around easily.*

*Should you use visa, you may get blocked from depositing on various sites; Bodog, WHill, Bet365 just to name a few. Withdrawals and clearing deposits with bank transfers or checks takes days-> weeks and gamblers ain’t gonna wait for that shit.*

*You can also buy prepaid paysafe cards from stores if you don’t wish to use your real credit card; and load that shit up.*

*One of the biggest markets this is prominent in is South east Asia, they are some of the biggest punters and fucking loving gambling. Looking at you pinoys, Indonesians, Malays. Not everyone wants to fly to Macau to get their rocks off.*

*As much as this is a play on FinTech, please understand this company has more or less the best Payment service on online gambling globally.*

# The Comparable VALUATIONS

From this chart you can see that there looks to be some favorable multiples that could improve once a deal closes. Also, I'm very bullish on the great Margins as well as the conservative growth. I think Foley along with the growing Igaming undervalues the potential of this company. Just the Draft Kings relationship make me tingle.

&#x200B;

This is an end to end payment processor with big big big name relationships for very disruptive companies that have huge addressable markets. The reason I am excited is because IGAMING is just really starting to take off and Paysafe is a first mover with brand new experienced management and very very fair valuations that could pop after a merger.

I have had an autoimmune disease, inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, crohn's), for the last 10 years. Its a tough disease - no medications really work with the best one achieving only a 30% success rate). So, it is a struggle for me to absorb the proper nutrition due to inflammation in the large intestine. It is a disease that has started to become very common in the US as new diagnosis are growing each year - maybe some fellow autists on WSB have it too. In fact, it was the reason for the recent abrupt retirement of Japan PM Shinzo Abe. It makes a lot of things in life hard.

Anyway, I keep seeing incredible innovative companies and biotechs and other medical companies coming up with all kinds of new breakthroughs for various diseases.  However, I never see any new and innovative company for inflammatory bowel disease. There has been the same ol' Abbvie and Humira but it has a very low success rate and only partial success. There are some private companies that do microbiome testing (i.e. Viome) which is speculated to be related to the disease but thus far I have not seen anything else for this disease.

As everyone knows, SPCE is about to do a flight test on Friday, Dec. 11 and many ppl believe the stock could rise significantly if the test goes well.

**(2)** ARKF bought nearly 19,000 shares of **DOCU** today on a day that JPMorgan downgraded the stock and the stock took a 6% share decline and is down after hours as well. What might be the ARKF reasoning to buy DOCU now when it seems its overvalued?",2020-12-10 08:42:50
