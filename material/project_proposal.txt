We're proposing a text analysis of the internet forum r/wallstreetbets subreddit to predict the popularity of posts from the post's text. It will be framed around the GameStop debacle involving the stock trading app Robinhood and the aforementioned subreddit. It involved a short squeeze and pump-and-dump scheme that increased the stock of GameStop by 20x, cost a hedge fund to reportedly lose >$5 billion, and resulted in a congressional hearing. It spotlighted many current social, political, and economical issues such as online echo-chambers, internet mob-mentality, the obfuscation of financial regulation, the bi-modality of the wealth distribution, and democratization of finance by technology firms.

Data will be scraped from r/wallstreetbets using the reddit API. Significant work will be needed to understand the substructure of the subreddit -- there are various types of posts (e.g. daily discussion, loss porn). Once the posts are pulled, the texts will need heavy cleaning (e.g. seperating posts from comments, removing posts that are primarily image-based (memes)). Upvotes and/or reddit gold will need to be extracted and matched to each post as these will serve as the outcome variable. The subreddit has a unique vernacular -- that can be extremely vulgar at times -- so special consideration will need to be made to account for their vocabulary.

The model will center on predicting upvotes/reddit gold based on post's texts and/or building an interpretable model to attempt to understand which words/phrases drive upvotes. A few models will be fitted included a logistic regression, naive bayes, tree-based methods, and possibly an RNN. Ultimately, our goal is to identify text trends (e.g. words, phrases) that drive the popularity of posts. The hope is this will further our understanding of the 'echo chamber' effect and the social discord regarding this intrinsic David vs. Goliath story.
